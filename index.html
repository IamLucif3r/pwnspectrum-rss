			<h3>Fortra patches critical GoAnywhere MFT flaw akin to past ransomware exploits</h3>
			<p>Fortra has released a patch for a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-10035) in its GoAnywhere MFT solution. This flaw, similar to a previous zero-day exploit, stems from insecure deserialization and allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands if they gain access to the Admin Console and forge a license response. The vulnerability has prompted concerns among security professionals about potential exploitation by ransomware groups, mirroring previous attacks targeting similar MFT solutions. While no active exploitation is currently known, proactive patching is strongly advised to mitigate the risk.</p>

			<p>WatchGuard has released a critical security advisory (WGSA-2025-00015) addressing a remote code exploit (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2025-9242, within its Firebox firewall systems. This flaw, affecting IKEv2 configurations used in mobile and branch office VPNs, allows attackers to bypass authentication. Despite potential lack of current usage, systems previously configured with vulnerable IKEv2 settings remain at risk due to persistent configuration data. The CVSS score is 9.3, highlighting the urgency for patching. This vulnerability aligns with a broader trend of firewall exploitation, mirroring recent attacks targeting backup systems and older firewall configurations. WatchGuard provides mitigation steps for customers unable to update immediately.</p>
