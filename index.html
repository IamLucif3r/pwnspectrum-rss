			<h3>Samsungs image library flaw opens a zero-click backdoor</h3>
			<p>&lt;div id=&#34;remove_no_follow&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column&#34;&gt;  &lt;div class=&#34;col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-column__content&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;wp-block-bigbite-multi-title&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;container&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung has disclosed a serious vulnerability affecting a core utility within its Android devices, one that has already been exploited in zero-day attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaw resides in a closed-source image-parsing library libimagecodec,quram.so supplied by Quramsoft, and allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted image files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zero-day exploits targeting popular apps and OEM libraries show just how fast attackers are shifting to mobile as their way in, said Brian Thornton, Senior Sales Engineer at Zimperium. Security teams should make sure employees update their Samsung devices right away and tighten up mobile defense plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Samsung has not said how the bug might impact &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.samsungknox.com/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;KNOX-protected&lt;/a&gt; enterprise environments, it is safe to assume risk as an RCE exploit can generally bypass user protections, undermine device management controls, or create a foothold for broader compromise in mixed personal-and-work fleets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all Android 13 through 16 devices impacted by the now-fixed vulnerability, many corporate fleets may still be vulnerable. The affected library is used widely across Samsung devices wherever image handling occurs, including system apps (Gallery, Camera), messaging apps, and third-party apps that rely on Samsungs image APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34;&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The bug behind the pixels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracked as&lt;a href=&#34;https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb#:~:text=SVE%2D2025%2D1702(CVE%2D2025%2D21043):%20Out%2Dof%2Dbounds%20Write%20in%20libimagecodec.quram.so&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt; CVE-2025-21043&lt;/a&gt;, the flaw is an out-of-bounds write issue in libimagecodec.quram.co, a Samsung-specific image parsing library. An attacker can trigger the bug with a specially crafted image file, leading to remote code execution (RCE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung confirmed the critical bug (CVSS 8.8 out of 10) was being exploited when Meta/WhatsApp &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/DonnchaC/status/1961444710620303653&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34;&gt;reported it privately&lt;/a&gt; in August. While attack specifics remain undisclosed, messaging apps are an obvious vector since they routinely process incoming images. Security experts stress that the exploit can run silently, requiring little or no action from the victima classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.csoonline.com/article/572727/zero-click-attacks-explained-and-why-they-are-so-dangerous.html&#34;&gt;zero-click threat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue reinforces the importance of strong mobile device governance, said Randolph Barr, chief information security officer at Cequence Security. Security teams must move beyond the debate of personal vs corporate control and focus on the reality: unmanaged devices are an organizational risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the person accountable for security will be the one questioned after an incident, leaders must socialize the need for mobile device management (MDM), provide clear evidence for why it matters, and tackle misconceptions head-on, Barr added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&#34;wp-block-heading&#34; id=&#34;patch-now-or-risk-a-backdoor&#34;&gt;Patch now or risk a backdoor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A September 2025 Release 1 patch addresses the flaw that affects devices running Android versions 13 through 16. Out-of-bounds Write in libimagecodec.quram.so prior to SMR Sep-2025 Release 1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, Samsung said in the disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprises, CVE-2025-21043 is more than a personal device issueit represents a potential backdoor into corporate networks. Exploitation could allow attackers to access sensitive business apps, email accounts, and even corporate data stored on the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devices with incomplete patching in bring-your-own-device (BYOD) or mixed-managed environments may inadvertently act as bridges into critical enterprise systems. Barr noted that tracking patch compliance can be challenging in BYOD setups, where users may resist MDM controls or updates. Outside of MDM, organizations using Entra ID or other SSO tools can often see logins by device and reach out to users directly to confirm updates. While updates are often automatic on Android devices, verification is still key, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

			<h3>The Ongoing Fallout from a Breach at AI Chatbot Maker Salesloft</h3>
			<p>The recent mass-theft of authentication tokens from Salesloft, whose AI chatbot is used by a broad swath of corporate America to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads, has left many companies racing to invalidate the stolen credentials before hackers can exploit them. Now Google warns the breach goes far beyond access to Salesforce data, noting the hackers responsible also stole valid authentication tokens for hundreds of online services that customers can integrate with Salesloft, including Slack, Google Workspace, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, and OpenAI.</p>

			<h3>Indirect Prompt Injection via YouTube Transcripts</h3>
			<p>As discussed previously the problem of Indirect Prompt Injections is increasing.They start showing up in many places.A new unique one that I ran across is YouTube transcripts. ChatGPT (via Plugins) can access YouTube transcripts. Which is pretty neat. However, as expected (and predicted by many researches) all these quickly built tools and integrations introduce Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.Proof of Concept Here is how it looks with ChatGPT end to end with a demo example.</p>

			<p>To learn more about Prompt Engineering and Prompt Injections I put together this tutorial &#43; lab for myself. It is as a Jupyter Notebook to experiement and play around with this novel attack technique, learn and experiment.The examples reach from simple prompt engineering scenarios, such as changing the output message to a specific text, to more complex adversarial prompt challenges such as JSON object injection, HTML injection/XSS, overwriting mail recipients or orders of an OrderBot and also data exfiltration.</p>

			<h3>Image to Prompt Injection with Google Bard</h3>
			<p>A prompt injection scenario that I, and others, have been wondering about in the past, is the potential risk associated with chatbots being able to analyze images.Could this ability open up the way for Indirect Prompt Injection attacks?Recently, Google added the ability to uploading and analyze images with Bard. And it turns out that it is indeed possible to add instructions to an image, and have the Bard follow those instructions.</p>

			<p>ChatGPT is vulnerable to data exfiltration via image markdown injections. This. is. pretty well known.As more features are added to ChatGPT the exfiltration angle becomes more likely to be abused.Recently OpenAI added Custom Instructions, which allow to have ChatGPT always automatically append instructions to every message exchange.An adversary can abuse this feature to install a data exfiltration backdoor that depends on, and only works because of the image markdown injection vulnerability.</p>

			<h3>gospray - Simple LDAP bind-based password spray tool</h3>
			<p>On a network and need credentials? Try password spraying the domain controller directly.A few years ago, I wrote this password spray tool called gospray that was used succesfully in a couple of engagements since. It does an LDAP bind directly against the domain controller to validate credentials. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an SMB server (or other servers) as target. So, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty quiet and number of concurrent Go routines is configurable.</p>

			<h3>Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration</h3>
			<p>Recently Google Bard got some powerful updates, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user&amp;rsquo;s personal documents and emails.So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with Google Docs.</p>

			<h3>Malicious ChatGPT Agents: How GPTs Can Quietly Grab Your Data (Demo)</h3>
			<p>When OpenAI released GPTs last month I had plans for an interesting GPT.Malicious ChatGPT Agents The idea was to create a kind of malware GPT that forwards users&amp;rsquo; chat messages to a third party server. It also asks users for personal information like emails and passwords.Why would this be possible end to end? ChatGPT cannot guarantee to keep your conversation private or confidential, because it loads images from any website.</p>

			<p>A few days ago Riley Goodside posted about an interesting discovery on how an LLM prompt injection can happen via invisible instructions in pasted text.
