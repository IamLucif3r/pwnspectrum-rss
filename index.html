			<h3>Samsungs image library flaw opens a zero-click backdoor</h3>
			<p>Samsung has disclosed a critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-21043, impacting libimagecodec.quram.so, a Samsung-specific image parsing library used across Android 13-16 devices. This out-of-bounds write vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) via specially crafted image files. Meta/WhatsApp privately reported the issue in August, highlighting messaging apps as a potential vector. The CVSS score of 8.8 indicates a high severity. Without patching, the flaw poses a significant risk, potentially enabling access to sensitive business apps, email accounts, and corporate data, especially within BYOD or mixed-managed environments. Organizations need to prioritize patching and implement robust mobile device management (MDM) strategies to mitigate this risk.</p>

			<h3>Cursor IDE: Arbitrary Data Exfiltration Via Mermaid (CVE-2025-54132)</h3>
			<p>A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-54132) was identified within the Cursor IDE, impacting its ability to render Mermaid diagrams. This flaw allows for unauthorized data exfiltration via the manipulation of the diagram&#39;s underlying graph data structure. Specifically, malicious actors can leverage the diagram rendering process to inject and subsequently exfiltrate sensitive information. Remediation involved a fix targeting the parsing of the Mermaid syntax and sanitization of the generated graph data, effectively mitigating the risk of this graph-based data exfiltration vector.</p>

			<h3>UK and allies expose Russian intelligence services for cyber campaign of attempted political interference</h3>
			<p>UK and allied intelligence agencies have attributed a coordinated cyber campaign to Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) operatives, specifically targeting critical infrastructure and government entities within the United Kingdom. The campaign involved sophisticated phishing attempts, credential stuffing, and potential exploitation of known vulnerabilities to compromise systems and gather intelligence related to political processes and democratic institutions. Attribution was based on forensic analysis of malware signatures and confirmed IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).</p>

			<h3>You will always remember this as the day you finally caught FamousSparrow</h3>
			<p>ESET threat researchers have identified and documented the attack chain employed by the FamousSparrow Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. This investigation revealed a suite of malware assets, including two previously uncharacterized iterations of the ‘SparrowDoor’ backdoor – designated as Variants 1 and 2. Analysis of the artifacts indicates a sophisticated exploitation of known vulnerabilities, employing techniques such as lateral movement and command and control (C2) channel obfuscation. Further investigation is ongoing to assess the full scope of the group&#39;s activity and potential impact.</p>
