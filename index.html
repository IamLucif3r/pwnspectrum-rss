			<h3>Samsungs image library flaw opens a zero-click backdoor</h3>
			<p>Samsung has disclosed a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) in its libimagecodec.quram.so image parsing library, which affects Android devices running versions 13 through 16. This ‘out-of-bounds write’ flaw allows remote code execution (RCE) via specially crafted image files. The vulnerability was privately reported to Samsung by Meta/WhatsApp in August and has been exploited in zero-click attacks. Due to the widespread use of this library across Samsung apps and potentially BYOD devices, it represents a significant risk for corporate networks, enabling access to sensitive data and systems. Patching is crucial to mitigate this RCE threat.</p>
