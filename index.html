			<h3>ChatGPT: Hacking Memories with Prompt Injection</h3>
			<p>OpenAI&#39;s recent memory feature in ChatGPT introduces a novel attack vector: Indirect Prompt Injection. This technique allows malicious actors to subtly influence the AI’s memory, potentially causing it to retain false data, exhibit biased responses, or execute unintended commands. The core vulnerability lies in the ability to manipulate the AI’s internal state through carefully crafted prompts.</p>
