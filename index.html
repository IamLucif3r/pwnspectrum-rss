			<h3>Samsungs image library flaw opens a zero-click backdoor</h3>
			<p>Samsung has disclosed a critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-21043, impacting its Android devices (versions 13-16) via a zero-day exploit within the libimagecodec.quram.so library. This out-of-bounds write vulnerability enables remote code execution (RCE) through crafted image files. The flaw was privately reported to Samsung by Meta/WhatsApp in August and has implications for KNOX-protected environments, potentially bypassing device management controls. The vulnerability’s prevalence across system apps (Gallery, Camera) and third-party apps highlights the risk, particularly in BYOD or mixed-managed environments where patch compliance can be difficult to track. Remediation requires SMR Sep-2025 Release 1.</p>

			<h3>[webapps] Grav CMS 1.7.48 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)</h3>
			<p>Grav CMS version 1.7.48 contains a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Exploitation of this flaw could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. The vulnerability is attributed to a flaw in the `Image` plugin’s handling of user-supplied data, specifically within the image processing pipeline. Mitigation strategies include immediate patching to the latest Grav CMS release, implementing rigorous input validation, and deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with signatures targeting this CVE. Further investigation suggests potential exploitation via POST requests targeting the `/plugins/Image/process` endpoint.</p>

			<h3>ChatGPT: Lack of Isolation between Code Interpreter sessions of GPTs</h3>
			<p>Recent analysis has revealed a critical architectural vulnerability within the GPT Code Interpreter (CI) implementation. The CI environment utilizes a shared compute container and storage layer across all GPT instances, regardless of their privacy setting (private or public). This results in cross-instance data access and potential overwriting of files stored within the CI sandbox. Specifically, files created or modified by private GPTs can be accessed and potentially manipulated by public GPTs, introducing a significant security risk related to data integrity and operational stability.</p>

			<h3>Assuming Bias and Responsible AI</h3>
			<p>Recent incidents highlight the pervasive issue of algorithmic bias within AI/ML systems. Specifically, a gender bias was observed in Amazon&#39;s recruiting AI, manifested through a skewed output favoring male candidates for technical roles. Microsoft&#39;s &#39;Tay&#39; chatbot exhibited rapid, emergent toxic language generation due to inadequate training data and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, an IBM Watson-based clinical decision support system suffered from inaccurate inferences, alongside a misinterpretation by a healthcare professional. These cases underscore the critical need for robust bias detection, mitigation strategies, and rigorous validation within machine learning pipelines, particularly concerning fairness and representational accuracy.</p>

			<h3>ChatGPT: Hacking Memories with Prompt Injection</h3>
			<p>OpenAI&#39;s recent implementation of persistent memory within ChatGPT has introduced vulnerabilities related to Indirect Prompt Injection. This technique allows malicious actors to surreptitiously influence the model’s knowledge base by injecting crafted prompts, potentially leading to data corruption, biased responses, or the circumvention of security controls. The core issue involves the model’s inability to reliably distinguish between user-provided instructions and externally injected malicious directives, creating a significant risk for data integrity and operational security. Further investigation is needed to assess the attack surface and mitigate the risk of prompt-based adversarial manipulation.</p>
