			<h3>Oracle issues emergency patch for zero-day flaw exploited by Cl0p ransomware gang</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Its the bad news that many customers of Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) have been dreading: reports of ransomware attacks targeting the software have turned out to be connected to a serious zero-day vulnerability that requires immediate patching.</p><p>The first indications that something might be awry emerged last week from <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4067501/cl0p-linked-threat-actors-target-oracle-e-business-suite-in-extortion-campaign.html" target="_blank">Halcyon, Googles Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), and Mandiant</a>, which issued alerts that one of the worlds most active extortion groups, <a href="https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/cl0p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cl0p</a>, was probably behind recent email demands sent to Oracle customers running internet-facing EBS ERP portals.</p><p>Although there was some initial uncertainty about the scope, severity, and attribution of the attacks, these reports revealed worrying details, including unusually large ransom demands of up to $50 million backed by proof of compromise such as screenshots and file trees.</p><p>We are the Cl0p team. If you havent heard about us, you can Google about us on the Internet, began one of the ransom notes, re-published by a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-patches-ebs-zero-day-exploited-in-clop-data-theft-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news site</a>.</p><p>The note went on to make the usual demand for payment, backed by threats to expose stolen data if ransom was not paid.</p><p>The worry was how the attackers were compromising victims. During 2025, Oracle has patched several important EBS security issues, including <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2025-30727</a> affecting the iSurvey Module, and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2025-21541</a> affecting Admin Screens and Grants UI, neither known to have been exploited.</p><p>The flaw exploited as part of the latest attack remains in question. A blog last week by Oracles CSO, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/authors/rob-duhart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Duhart</a>, indicated that multiple vulnerabilities from the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July 2025 Oracle Critical Patch Update (CPU)</a> might be involved. However, this was later updated to remove that reference.</p><p>A post by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charlescarmakal_oracle-security-alert-advisory-cve-2025-activity-7380595612443893760-JNd_/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Carmakal of Mandiant</a> still refers to multiple vulnerabilities, but the focus has now shifted to a new remote code execution (RCE) flaw, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2025-61882</a>, as the main culprit. The fact that Oracle issued <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an emergency patch</a> for it during the weekend seems to confirm this.</p><p>Initial access by Cl0p dates to August, which means that attackers have had plenty of time to steal large amounts of data. Extortion emails were sent to victims from September 29 onwards, but might not yet have reached all victims, Carmakal cautioned.</p><p>Given the broad mass 0-day exploitation that has already occurred (and the n-day exploitation that will likely continue by other actors), irrespective of when the patch is applied, organizations should examine whether they were already compromised, he said.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="red-alert-patch-now">Red alert: Patch now</h2><p>Rated a critical 9.8 on CVSS, CVE-2025-61882 is a vulnerability in the EBS BI Publisher Integration component of Oracle E-Business Suite affecting <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">versions 12.2.3 to 12.2.14</a>, which is remotely exploitable without authentication.</p><p>Customers should apply the latest patch after first applying the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical patch update from October 2023</a> if they hadnt already done so. Any versions of the software updated before October 4 should be considered at risk.</p><p>Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply the updates provided by this Security Alert as soon as possible, the company warned.</p><p>Oracle also published a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs), including IP addresses, observed commands, and malware signatures, to aid in detection.</p><p>Its likely that almost no one patched over the weekend. Were waking up to a critical vulnerability with public exploit code and unpatched systems everywhere, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-knott-046939107/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake Knott</a>, principal security researcher at continuous security testing company, <a href="https://watchtowr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">watchTowr</a>.</p><p>We fully expect to see mass, indiscriminate exploitation from multiple groups within days. If you run Oracle EBS, this is your red alert. Patch immediately, hunt aggressively, and tighten your controls  fast.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zbyneksopuch/?originalSubdomain=cz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zbynk Sopuch</a>, CTO of data security vendor, <a href="https://www.safetica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safetica</a>, enterprises should also note the evolving cyber criminal behavior signaled by recent ransomware attacks.</p><p>The targeted systems-of-choice for thieves include ERP, finance, HR, and the typical points of entry are via admin credentials and third-party connectors, such as VPNs, middleware, and API service accounts, which tend to have open access privileges, said Sopuch.</p><p>He recommended that companies isolate critical applications as much as possible, while making protections such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) standard for admin logins and integration or API access points.</p><p>Conversely, give service and integration accounts minimum access or simple access-appropriate-to-role permissions, and routinely rotate keys, he said.</p><p>Zero-day vulnerabilities seem to be particularly favored by Cl0p, with the 2023 attack against the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/575481/clop-ransomware-gang-exploits-the-moveit-transfer-vulnerability-to-steal-data.html?utm=hybrid_search" target="_blank">MOVEit file transfer customers</a> exploiting CVE-2023-34362 a high-profile example. Other attacks with the same approach included those against Accellion in 2020, and SolarWinds in 2021.</p><p>The lesson is that organizations can detect incursions only if they are continuously monitoring all risk points in the attack surface, such as external access points and logins, said Sopuch.</p></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>Cyber-Bedrohungslage in der EU verschrft sich</h3>
			<p>The cybersecurity threat landscape in the EU has significantly worsened, according to a new report by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). <span class="tech-jargon">Ransomware<span class="jargon-expl">Malicious software that encrypts files and demands a ransom.</span></span> remains the leading threat, causing substantial damage as seen in recent disruptions at European airports. Distributed Denial-of-Service (<span class="tech-jargon">DDoS<span class="jargon-expl">A type of cyberattack that overwhelms a system with traffic.</span></span>) attacks are also prevalent, accounting for the majority of reported incidents. The ENISA report highlights a growing trend of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance attack strategies, particularly in social engineering campaigns. Furthermore, the public sector is a frequent target of cyberattacks, including espionage efforts. The report, based on 4875 incidents from July 2024 to June 2025, underscores the interconnectedness of digital systems and the resulting impact across entire supply chains.</p>

			<h3>Oracle E-Business Suite users targeted in extortion campaign</h3>
			<p>Oracle E-Business Suite users are being targeted in an extortion campaign by a threat actor, likely affiliated with the Cl0p gang. The attack involves impersonating data theft, leveraging compromised email accounts and default password reset functions to gain access. Attackers are demanding substantial ransoms, supported by fabricated evidence. The campaign highlights misconfigurations and a lack of MFA, exposing thousands of organizations. While the exact methods remain under investigation, the tactic aligns with Cl0p's prior activities and the potential for data exfiltration is a significant concern. Organizations are advised to implement enhanced security measures, including restricting internet access to EBS portals, enforcing MFA, and actively monitoring for anomalous activity. This situation underscores the importance of proactive threat intelligence and robust security practices, particularly around critical applications.</p>

			<h3>Cyberbedrohungslage fr KMUs spitzt sich zu</h3>
			<p>Cyberattacks targeting mid-sized companies in Germany have increased dramatically (over quadrupled) between 2021 and 2024, placing Germany as a top nation for these attacks. <span class="tech-jargon">Ransomware<span class="jargon-expl">Malicious software that encrypts data and demands payment for its release.</span></span> is the dominant threat, with 80% of 950 analyzed cases involving small and medium enterprises. Attackers frequently use "<span class="tech-jargon">Double Extortion<span class="jargon-expl">A ransomware tactic involving data encryption followed by threats to publish stolen information.</span></span>," encrypting data and then threatening to publish stolen information. <span class="tech-jargon">Phishing<span class="jargon-expl">A cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to trick victims into revealing sensitive information.</span></span> attacks targeting employees are also common, with executives facing an average of 57 targeted attacks annually.  A significant proportion (less than 2%) of German SMEs have adequate cybersecurity protection, and many underestimate the sophistication of current attacks.  The increasing complexity of IT security infrastructure and a shortage of IT professionals further exacerbate the vulnerability of these companies.  Given the rise in AI-powered attacks, a basic level of protection is no longer sufficient for German SMEs.</p>

			<h3>Chinese APT group Phantom Taurus targets gov and telecom organizations</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Researchers have documented a previously unknown threat actor that aligns with Chinas intelligence collection interests. The group primarily targets government and telecommunications organizations from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia with the goal of maintaining long-term covert access to critical systems.</p><p>Over the past two years researchers from Palo Alto Networks have investigated separate clusters of malicious activity that have now been attributed to the same group: <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/phantom-taurus/">Phantom Taurus</a>. Before, the company tracked these attacks under temporary names, such as CL-STA-0043, TGR-STA-0043, or <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/operation-diplomatic-specter/">Operation Diplomatic Specter</a>.</p><p>Our observations show that Phantom Taurus main focus areas include ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, geopolitical events, and military operations, the researchers wrote in their new report. The groups primary objective is espionage. Its attacks demonstrate stealth, persistence and an ability to quickly adapt their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).</p><p>Part of the groups extensive toolset of custom-developed malware tools includes a suite of three previously undocumented backdoors for Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers that the researchers dubbed NET-STAR. Other tools include in-memory Visual Basic script implants, a malware family called Specter that includes the TunnelSpecter DNS tunneling program and SweetSpecter remote access trojan, Agent Racoon, PlugX, Gh0st RAT, China Chopper, Mimikatz, Impacket, and many other dual-use tools and system administration utilities.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-change-in-tactics">A change in tactics</h2><p>Previously, Phantom Taurus focused on harvesting mailboxes of interest from Exchange servers that were compromised using known vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855) and <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/571223/unpatched-exchange-servers-an-overlooked-risk.html">ProxyShell</a> (CVE-2021-34473). But this year the researchers noticed that the attackers had started searching for and extracting data from SQL databases.</p><p>The group uses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) tool to execute a script called <code>mssq.bat</code> that connects to an SQL database using the <code>sa</code> (system administrator) ID with a password previously obtained by the attackers. It then performs a dynamic search for specific keywords specified in the script, saving the results as a CSV file.</p><p>The threat actor used this method to search for documents of interest and information related to specific countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, the researchers said.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="net-star-malware-suite">NET-STAR malware suite</h2><p>A newly discovered addition to Phantom Taurus toolset this year is a set of web-based backdoors designed to interact with IIS web servers.</p><p>The main component, called IIServerCore, operates within the memory of the w3wp.exe IIS worker process and is capable of loading other fileless payloads directly into memory, executing arbitrary commands and command-line arguments.</p><p>The initial component of IIServerCore is an ASPX web shell named OutlookEN.aspx, the researchers wrote. This web shell contains an embedded Base64-compressed binary, the IIServerCore backdoor. When the web shell executes, it loads the backdoor into the memory of the <code>w3wp.exe</code> process and invokes the Run method, which is the main function of IIServerCore.</p><p>Another component, called AssemblyExecuter V1, is designed to execute .NET assembly bytecode in memory, whereas the enhanced version, AssemblyExecuter V2, is capable of bypassing the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).</p><p>The components seemingly benign code structure results in minimal flagging by antivirus engines on VirusTotal, at the time of writing this article, the researchers said. This demonstrates a technique that threat actors can use to create tools that avoid overt code, which detection systems might interpret as malicious.</p><p>Phantom Taurus uses APT operational infrastructure associated in the past exclusively with other Chinese threat actors, such as Iron Taurus (aka APT27), Starchy Taurus (aka Winnti), and Stately Taurus (aka Mustang Panda). However, the specific infrastructure components used by Phantom Taurus have not been observed with the other groups, suggesting this is a separate group that compartmentalizes its operations.</p></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>Newly-discovered threat group hijacking IIS servers for SEO fraud, warns Cisco Talos</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>A Chinese-speaking cybercrime group is aggressively targeting vulnerable Internet Information Server (IIS) web servers for use in search engine optimization (SEO) fraud, as well as for the theft of high-value data, researchers at Cisco Talos have warned.</p><p>The servers most at risk from attacks right now are in universities, technology companies, and telecom providers in India, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, and Brazil, the company said.</p><p>This targeting isnt coincidental; the group, identified as <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/uat-8099-chinese-speaking-cybercrime-group-seo-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UAT-8099</a>, chooses its victims for their high domain and IP reputation, which makes it less likely SEO fraud activity will be detected or blocked.</p><p>Cisco Talos doesnt say how many servers the group has compromised, but the fact it has been given its own ID suggests the volume is significant. Its also possible that the campaign will eventually expand to other countries, including the US and UK.</p><p>The tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) described by Cisco offer an interesting insight into the deeper workings of SEO fraud.</p><p>To gain initial access, UAT-8099 targets weakly-configured IIS servers that allow unrestricted file uploads for applications such as content management systems (CMS).</p><p>The group subverts this feature to upload a web shell and create a guest account, the privileges of which are immediately elevated to admin level. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is then enabled, at which point the attackers have enough control over the server to install the BadIIS SEO malware.</p><p>To achieve persistence, the attackers create a hidden admin account. They enable backdoor access via the SoftEther VPN or EasyTier decentralized VPN tools to hide RDP traffic and avoid detection, and use FRP reverse proxy to initiate outward connections from the server to further obscure the compromise.</p><p>To stop other crime groups from exploiting the compromised server, UAT-8099 installs the D_Safe_Manage IIS security tool, which rather rubs in the fact that the defenders should have used this or an equivalent tool for the same purpose.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-seo-fraud">Why SEO fraud?</h2><p>Poisoning search engines, especially Google, is an important enabler of cybercrime.</p><p>The aim of this exercise is to elevate malicious or fraudulent links to as near the top of search results as possible.</p><p>If the attackers served these links from a malicious website, theyd be easily filtered. The answer is to hijack someone elses site, preferably one with a high-reputation domain and IP. This means that the search crawler sees pages on a reputable IIS server which the attacker has filled with keyword-friendly terms and hidden backlinks to other reputable but similarly hijacked web servers.</p><p>This elevates the ranking of these pages in search, therefore making them more likely to be noticed and clicked on. When users do click, they are fed injected ads or malicious landing pages hosted elsewhere that crawlers dont see.</p><p>As a backup revenue source, UAT-8099 also steals any credentials and other sensitive data it can find on compromised servers to re-sell to other criminals.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-do">What to do</h2><p>IIS, and the applications running on it, are always targets for attackers exploiting CVE-level vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. One example of this was the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3820852/hackers-breach-microsoft-iis-services-using-cityworks-rce-bug.html" target="_blank">Cityworks RCE vulnerability</a> from earlier in 2025. And in July, the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/647022/lazarus-group-exploits-windows-iis-servers-to-distribute-malware.html" target="_blank">North Korean Lazarus group</a> was reported to have compromised IIS servers in South Korea to distribute malware to users of the INISAFE CrossWeb EX V6 banking security software.</p><p>The current attacks have been ongoing since at least April, which means that organizations should first check their IIS estates for existing compromise. To aid in this, Cisco Talos has published a <a href="https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/IOCs/blob/main/2025/09/uat-8099-chinese-speaking-cybercrime-group-seo-fraud.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github page</a> listing file hashes and malicious domains associated with UAT-8099 to look for in logs.</p><p>Servers should also be configured to prevent IIS from executing uploaded scripts or files by adding a StaticFile handler to the upload folder. This stops attackers from hiding executables and scripts behind innocuous-looking uploads.</p><p>Finally, its important to disable RDP access on port 3389, and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin access. At the very least, a SIEM should be enabled to ingest logs from IIS. With the right alerts, these should reveal unusual file changes or additions.</p><p></p></div></div></div></div></p>
