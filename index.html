			<h3>Salesforces glaring Dreamforce omission: Vital security lessons from Salesloft Drift</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Salesforces <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3516181/dreamforce-2024-latest-news-and-insights.html">2025 Dreamforce conference</a> last week offered attendees a range of sessions on best practices for securing their Salesforce environments and AI agents, and about what Salesforce itself is doing with AI to improve security. The company even <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4069285/salesforce-ai-agents-set-to-assist-enterprises-with-security-and-compliance.html">released two new agents aimed at CISOs ahead of the event</a>, one to handle security issues and an agent for addressing privacy and compliance.</p><p>Overall, security as a shared responsibility was the theme: Salesforce is doing its part, and customers need to do theirs.</p><p>But what the conference didnt address were weaknesses exposed by the recent spate of Salesforce-related breaches that affected more than 700 companies and nearly 1.5 billion records, inspiring 70-plus lawsuits.</p><p>I was at the event, and I talked to all the leadership, and this was not one of the topics, says Chirag Mehta, a vice president at Constellation Research. This didnt come up.</p><p>The omission was a likely missed opportunity, given that the lessons of what has gone down in the Salesforce ecosystem over the past few months are significant for the increasingly connected and AI-infused future that is central to Salesforces agentic vision.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="anatomy-of-a-third-party-cyber-disaster">Anatomy of a third-party cyber disaster</h2><p>At issue is one of the largest SaaS supply-chain breaches in recent years. According to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift">Google Threat Intelligence Group</a>, over <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/salesforce-salesloft-drift-attack-spree-google/">700 organizations</a> were impacted by an August breach in which the actor systematically exported large volumes of data from numerous corporate Salesforce instances.</p><p>Seeing as the data had been stored by Salesforce, non-cyber professionals might assume this was a Salesforce breach, but that was not the case, Mehta says.</p><p>Yes, the breach happened in a Salesforce instance, he explains. But it was not caused by something Salesforce did. The people who understand whats going on, they understand what Salesforce is supposed to do, and what the customers were supposed to do.</p><p>Instead, the breach occurred when a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4046407/attackers-steal-data-from-salesforce-instances-via-compromised-ai-live-chat-tool.html">threat actor obtained Salesforce OAuth tokens</a> from third-party AI chat tool Salesloft Drift and used the tokens to download large volumes of data from Salesforce instances.</p><p>Salesforce, which has attempted to minimize the breachs severity by saying <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005134951&amp;type=1">a small number of customers</a> were affected, noted that when it detected the activity, it invalidated active Access and Refresh Tokens, and removed Drift from AppExchange. We then notified affected customers.</p><p>But according to Salesforce customer Cloudflare, the CDN giant saw the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/response-to-salesloft-drift-incident/">first signs</a> of reconnaissance related to the breach on Aug. 9, with an attacker gaining access to Cloudflares Salesforce tenant on Aug. 12. By Aug. 17, the attackers had analyzed Cloudflares Salesforce case workflows, derived insights into how Cloudflares team members handle various types of cases, and completed their exfiltration.</p><p>Three days later, on Aug. 20, Salesforce revoked Salesloft Drift connections and published its notice on its website. At that point, Cloudflare had not yet been notified, and we had no indication that this vendor action might relate to our environment, Cloudflares security leaders stated.</p><p>Cloudflare wasnt alone. Hundreds of companies were affected, including some of the biggest names in cybersecurity.</p><p><a href="https://www.mitiga.io/blog/shinyhunters-and-unc6395-inside-the-salesforce-and-salesloft-breaches">Mitiga Security researcher Idan Cohen wrote</a>: In the Drift case, customers werent careless. The attackers didnt hack their way in. They logged in, pretending to be a trusted third-party service.</p><p>This wasnt the only case involving breached Salesforce accounts. In June, a different group of attackers, known as ShinyHunters, <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4035701/we-too-were-breached-says-google-months-after-revealing-salesforce-attacks.html">pretended to be IT support personnel</a>, in order to trick users into approving a connection to a malicious version of Salesforces Data Loader application that then exfiltrated data from Salesforce environments.</p><p>Google, whose threat intelligence team described these attacks in a June report, itself fell victim to such an attack in August.</p><p>By October, <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4067846/extortion-gang-opens-data-leak-site-to-squeeze-victims-of-its-salesforce-attacks.html">attackers claimed to have stolen more than 1.5 billion Salesforce records</a> from 760 companies. They also launched an extortion campaign against Salesforce and its compromised enterprise customers, including Toyota, FedEx, Hulu, and UPS.</p><p>Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Salesforce, claiming the company didnt do enough to vet third-party applications connected to its systems, or to monitor for signs of data exfiltration and other malicious activity.</p><p>Salesforce  had the duty and ability to control its software environment and prevent these attacks from succeeding through implementation of security protocols that other companies in Salesforces industry regularly and routinely implement. But Salesforce did not, said one complaint in a <a href="https://mdlcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MDL-3164.pdf">class-action lawsuit</a> filed on Aug. 29 in California.</p><p>The potential for OAuth exploitation was a known risk and Salesforce failed to vet third-party connections, build protections, or monitor its networks against this kind of malicious activity, another group of class-action claimants said in a <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/filings/DM725Z2I/Johnson_v_Salesforce_Inc__candce-25-08011__0001.0.pdf">complaint</a> filed in September.</p><p>According to San Diego law firm CaseyGerry, there are now more than <a href="https://caseygerry.com/blog/salesforce-data-breach-lawsuit/">70 cases filed</a> across the country related to the Salesforce data breach.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-biggest-blind-spot">The biggest blind spot</h2><p>When companies delegate access to third parties via OAuth integrations, it creates a systemic security blind spot that spans all industries.</p><p>By stealing those tokens, attackers can gain access to all connected systems. Authorizing a malicious connected app bypasses many traditional defenses such as MFA, password resets and login monitoring, and because OAuth tokens are issued by Salesforce itself, activity coming from the malicious app can look like its from a trusted integration, the FBI <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2025/250912.pdf">warned</a> in an alert released in September.</p><p>The exploitation of such weaknesses is only going to get worse  especially as AI-related integrations increasingly become the norm.</p><p>Whereas a traditional CRM integration might need contact data, an AI sales assistant typically requires contacts, email histories, calendar information, deal pipeline data, conversation logs, and product catalogs, noted Trend Micro AI security expert Fernando Tucci in a report on why the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/ai-app-breach.html">breach of Salesloft Drift  an AI chatbot  hits differently</a>. This broader access pattern means a single compromised AI integration can expose significantly more sensitive information than traditional point solutions.</p><p>Worse, because AI chatbots are specifically designed to access large data sets, when a malicious actor piggybacks on the same connection to steal data, the traffic pattern can look legitimate.</p><p>Understanding all these partnerships and connections requires close coordination with vendor management, says Steve Winterfeld, advisory CISO at Akamai. Plus, understanding where your data is takes both culture-driven policies and technical controls, he says.</p><p>With white-labeled services, APIs, and now LLMs, these two goals are much more complex. If you havent conducted a supply chain breach exercise yet, now is the time, Winterfeld says. These recent events underscore the importance of validating your program.</p><p>Ironically, many security firms were among the victims, including Zscaler, Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, Pager Duty, SpyCloud, Tenable, Proofpoint, Rubrik, BeyondTrust, Bugcrowd, JFrog, CyberArk, and Black Duck.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="one-company-who-didnt-fall-victim">One company who didnt fall victim</h2><p>One company that wasnt scathed by the breaches was cloud-based IAM vendor Okta. Why? It allowed connections only from authorized IP addresses.</p><p><a href="https://www.okta.com/newsroom/articles/the-salesloft-incident--a-wake-up-call-for-saas-security-and-ips/">According to Okta</a>, when the company learned of the compromise, it immediately reviewed its logs and found attempts to access resources with stolen tokens  but those attempts failed.</p><p>The single most important control that prevented this breach was our enforcement of inbound IP restrictions, the company said. The threat actor attempted to use a compromised token to access our Salesforce instance, but the attack failed because the connection originated from an unauthorized IP address. This security layer proved essential, blocking the unauthorized attempt at the front door before any access could be gained.</p><p>This whitelisting approach to security is a powerful tactic, but its difficult to implement because it requires a great deal of discipline.</p><p>Another challenge is that not all SaaS vendors support this capability. Many providers in the cloud-first world do not offer this foundational security feature, creating a significant challenge for protecting interconnected systems, Okta said.</p><p>Foundational security benchmarks for SaaS providers are only now coming together, following the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4063383/cloud-security-alliance-launches-framework-to-improve-saas-security.html">Cloud Security Alliances recently launched SaaS Security Capability Framework (SSCF)</a>.</p><p>Okta noted that Salesforce already offers this functionality, but added that using it requires significant effort, given that restrictions have to be configured for APIs and users.</p><p>Another way to protect connections is to limit them to a specific client, using demonstrating proof of possession (DPoP), which prevents the reuse of stolen tokens, but this is even more difficult in practice because it requires changes to the authentication flow and adds new requirements for clients and servers. Another option is mutual TLS, which offers even stronger security, but at an even higher cost of complexity.</p><p>In the financial sector, for example, some regulators mandate DPoP or mTLS; while it isnt mandated in healthcare, theres a use case there as well, according to <a href="https://tyk.io/blog/demonstrating-proof-of-possession-dpop-oauth2-security-for-fapi-2-0-and-open-banking/">Tyk Technologies</a>.</p><p>More companies should be looking at upgrading this as their use of interconnected SaaS apps and AI tools increases.</p><p>The Internet Engineering Task Force <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700#name-sender-constrained-access-t">included</a> both DPoP and mTLS among its best practices for OAuth security.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="compounding-risk-going-forward">Compounding risk going forward</h2><p>When companies allow connections to systems outside their perimeter, they need to understand the risks they are assuming and the security controls available to them, Constellations Mehta says.</p><p>Even a control as straightforward and common as multi-factor authentication can be difficult to implement for all employees, he says.</p><p>From a solution provider perspective, they provide a specific set of security controls and features and its up to the customers to make sure they actually use them. In my view, it is a shared responsibility, Mehta says.</p><p>Shared responsibility for security was an important part of the message of last weeks Dreamforce, but discussion of the Salesloft incident was conspicuously missing a loss for attendees.</p><p>Because if anything can be taken away from the past few months of Salesforce-related cybersecurity, its that software supply-chain security is more important than ever. And it will only increase in importance as more systems get connected  a key tenet of <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4066640/salesforce-trusted-ai-foundation-provides-scaffolding-for-the-agentic-enterprise.html">Salesforces aim to power the agentic enterprise</a>.</p><p>Software supply-chain security is already not so easy to achieve, and, even as Salesforce promises to make this easier with the help of AI, it is AI itself that will make the problem that much harder to solve.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">More <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3490106/salesforce-latest-news-and-insights.html">Salesforce news</a>:</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4071597/salesforce-updates-its-agentic-ai-pitch-with-agentforce-360.html">Salesforce updates its agentic AI pitch with Agentforce 360</a></li><li><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/4070540/lessons-from-the-salesforce-breach.html">Lessons from the Salesforce breach</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4069900/salesforce-brings-agentic-ai-to-it-service-management.html">Salesforce brings agentic AI to IT service management</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4046713/salesforce-ai-research-unveils-new-tools-for-ai-agents.html">Salesforce AI Research unveils new tools for AI agents</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>AI browsers can be abused by malicious AI sidebar extensions: Report</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>AI browsers may be smart, but theyre not smart enough to block a common threat: Malicious extensions.</p><p>Thats the conclusion of researchers at SquareX, who on Thursday <a href="https://labs.sqrx.com/ai-sidebar-spoofing-720e0c91d290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a report</a> showing how attackers can exploit AI sidebars through compromised browser extensions.</p><p>This attack vector isnt new. Malicious extensions have been <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4017474/verified-but-vulnerable-malicious-extensions-exploit-ide-trust-badges.html" target="_blank">inserted into browser web stores</a> to infect standard browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others for years.</p><p>What SquareX discovered are malicious extensions that can spoof the legitimate AI sidebars people use for queries. Their goal is to trick users into going to malicious websites, running data exfiltration commands, or installing backdoors. AI sidebar spoofing even works on the just-released OpenAI Atlas browser, SquareX says.</p><p>One solution for CISOs and CIOs is to ban the use of AI browsers, it suggests. That assumes the IT department can manage which browsers staff are using, particularly if they are allowed to use their own internet-connected devices. At the very least, IT must audit all extensions installed by employees for AI and non-AI browsers, the report says.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="treat-anything-ai-with-zero-trust-protocols">Treat anything AI with zero-trust protocols</h2><p>CISOs and CIOs need to treat anything AI with the strongest zero-trust protocols available, commented <a href="https://cypfer.com/team-member/ed-dubrovsky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ed Dubrovsky</a>, chief operating officer of incident response firm Cypfer, at least until some better functioning guardrails are established.</p><p>Establish a set of guardrails around AI use and functionality, he said, and if you are allowing AI vulnerable software into your corporate network, segment it into a place where it cant get into the Digital Crown Jewels, or even have an awareness of them.</p><p>He pointed out that AI is a completely different playing field, and CSOs are not yet prepared for it. The challenge is that IT leaders are trying to think of AI as a new tool or toolset and are trying to apply software development and maintenance methodologies to its management.</p><p>But in his view, AI is closer to I just hired 100 new employees with very little vetting or appropriate security controls, how do I secure my assets in case some of them are malicious?</p><p>AI is not only a language chatbot, but it also has agentic function where tasks are defined and deployed, and AI software can be written and deployed by AI, he said. This pushes the human away from the keyboard, in a way, and replaces it with a new software capability.</p><p>The risk is that AI is not, and likely never will be, completely foolproof, he added. There may come a day where AI will be powerful enough to avoid most human ability to fool it, but, he asked, can it avoid being manipulated by other AIs?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dumpster-fires">Dumpster fires</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/?originalSubdomain=ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Shipley</a>, head of Canadian employee security awareness training firm Beauceron Security, agrees.</p><p>I think if CISOs are bored and want to spice up their lives with an incident, they should roll out these AI-powered hot messes to their users, he said .</p><p>But, if theyre like most CISOs and they have lots of problems, but free time and boredom arent on that list, they should avoid these dumpster fires [AI browsers] at all costs.</p><p>Building and supporting a legitimate browser and extension ecosystem is difficult work, he argued, pointing out that even Apple, Google, and Microsoft still have issues.</p><p>I think its a mistake to think of the risk as just being about extensions, he added. Its the fundamental DNA of these browsers that is bad; the companies arent incented to pay enough attention to the problems, and bad extensions are just the straw that breaks cybersecuritys back.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>CISOs have a tough challenge: Its not hard to fool an employee into downloading and installing a malicious extension for any browser; browser extensions are supposed to be attractive add-on utilities such as password managers or AI productivity assistants. They are promoted in phishing and smishing messages, social media posts and, when threat actors are able, uploaded to marketplaces such as the Google Chrome Web Store. They can be malware disguised as a legitimate extension or can be a compromised version of one.</p><p>In AI Sidebar Spoofing, says the SquareX report, once a victim opens a new AI browser tab, the malicious extension injects JavaScript into the web page to create a fake sidebar that looks exactly like a legitimate sidebar. When the user enters a prompt into the spoofed sidebar, the extension hooks into its AI engine. But if the prompt requests certain instructions or guides, the responses can be manipulated to include additional instructions to the user. So, for example, if the user asks for good file sharing sites, the malicious extension might provide a link to the attackers file sharing site that requests high risk OAuth permissions that it can harvest. In the hands of a hacker, they could allow access to the victims email.</p><p>In one test, when a SquareX researcher asked a malicious sidebar extension how to install the Homebrew package manager for macOS or Linux, the instructions included an installation command line that executed a reverse shell command that would have connected the victims device to the attackers server. That would have given the attacker a system shell in which to execute commands on the victims machine.</p><p>Its critical that infosec leaders set granular browser-native policies that prevent users from carrying out malicious tasks as instructed by a fake AI sidebar, says the report. These would include a policy that blocks advanced phishing sites using advanced machine learning and page heuristic analysis, a policy that blocks high risk permissions from being granted to non-allowlisted apps, and a policy that warns users about and blocks copies of malicious/risky Linux commands.</p><p>The research is a warning shot for the early days of agentic browsing and [reminds users] that the implicit trust model of the UI needs rethinking, said <a href="https://www.exabeam.com/blog/incident-response/what-the-most-significant-government-collaboration-on-threat-detection-and-logging-got-right-and-wrong-and-what-you-should-know-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabrielle Hempel</a>, security operations strategist at Exabeam.</p><p>The main issue here is that agentic-AI browsers introduce an entirely new attack surface. This attack, a malicious extension injecting a fake AI sidebar overlay that looks like the real one, allows threat actors to hijack the trusted AI assistant UI and trick users into executing dangerous operations, she pointed out. Organizations need to be taking this seriously, because when you delegate browsing and actions to an AI sidebar, you are elevating what previously might have been a minor risk into a material risk to cloud assets, credentials, and devices.</p><p>IT leaders should restrict AI browser use for high-risk functions until they are proven secure, she advised, adding that, because the attack uses an extension with host and storage permissions, organizations should revisit their extension approval workflows for those as well. In fact, any productivity tool that requests broad access should require scrutiny. </p><p>Segmentation is also important once these tools are implemented: least privilege applies here and AI interaction with certain tabs/services should be limited, she said.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/4078274/ai-browsers-can-be-abused-by-malicious-ai-sidebar-extensions-report.html" target="_blank">Computerworld</a>.</em></p></div></div></div></div></p>

And its spreading right now.</p><p>If the compromised extensions are folded into code, they harvest NPM, GitHub, and Git credentials left by developers in their work, drain funds from 49 cryptocurrency wallets, deploy SOCKS proxy servers on developer computers, install hidden VNX servers for remote access, and use stolen credentials to compromise additional packages and extensions.</p><p>Seven OpenVSX extensions were compromised last week and were downloaded over 35,000 times, the report says. In addition, another infected extension was detected in the VS Code marketplace over the weekend.</p><p>The worms in the extensions evade detection using an old technique: Including malware written with Unicode variation selectors.

Open code marketplaces, where developers can upload code for others to use in their applications, have long been targets for threat actors as vehicles for inserting malicious code into projects. The code then spreads into developer or customer environments to steal credentials and data. Collectively, these are known as supply chain attacks.</p><p>Among the most targeted repositories are GitHub, GitLab and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/4060306/npm-attacks-and-the-security-of-software-supply-chains.html" target="_blank">NPM</a>.</p><p>Microsoft gives developers the ability to add extensionsand themes to Visual Studio Code to make life easier for developers, as well as to enhance functionality.An extension can add features like debuggers, new languages, or other development tools, while a theme is a type of extension that changes the appearance of the editor, controlling things like colors and fonts.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="leverages-blockchain">Leverages blockchain</h2><p>Koi Security researchers came across the wormed extension in OpenVSX when their risk engine flagged suspicious activity in an update of an extension called CodeJoy. a developer productivity tool with hundreds of downloads.

			<h3>Salesforces glaring Dreamforce omission: Vital security lessons from Salesloft Drift</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Salesforces <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3516181/dreamforce-2024-latest-news-and-insights.html">2025 Dreamforce conference</a> last week offered attendees a range of sessions on best practices for securing their Salesforce environments and AI agents, and about what Salesforce itself is doing with AI to improve security. The company even <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4069285/salesforce-ai-agents-set-to-assist-enterprises-with-security-and-compliance.html">released two new agents aimed at CISOs ahead of the event</a>, one to handle security issues and an agent for addressing privacy and compliance.</p><p>Overall, security as a shared responsibility was the theme: Salesforce is doing its part, and customers need to do theirs.</p><p>But what the conference didnt address were weaknesses exposed by the recent spate of Salesforce-related breaches that affected more than 700 companies and nearly 1.5 billion records, inspiring 70-plus lawsuits.</p><p>I was at the event, and I talked to all the leadership, and this was not one of the topics, says Chirag Mehta, a vice president at Constellation Research. This didnt come up.</p><p>The omission was a likely missed opportunity, given that the lessons of what has gone down in the Salesforce ecosystem over the past few months are significant for the increasingly connected and AI-infused future that is central to Salesforces agentic vision.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="anatomy-of-a-third-party-cyber-disaster">Anatomy of a third-party cyber disaster</h2><p>At issue is one of the largest SaaS supply-chain breaches in recent years. According to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift">Google Threat Intelligence Group</a>, over <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/salesforce-salesloft-drift-attack-spree-google/">700 organizations</a> were impacted by an August breach in which the actor systematically exported large volumes of data from numerous corporate Salesforce instances.</p><p>Seeing as the data had been stored by Salesforce, non-cyber professionals might assume this was a Salesforce breach, but that was not the case, Mehta says.</p><p>Yes, the breach happened in a Salesforce instance, he explains. But it was not caused by something Salesforce did. The people who understand whats going on, they understand what Salesforce is supposed to do, and what the customers were supposed to do.</p><p>Instead, the breach occurred when a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4046407/attackers-steal-data-from-salesforce-instances-via-compromised-ai-live-chat-tool.html">threat actor obtained Salesforce OAuth tokens</a> from third-party AI chat tool Salesloft Drift and used the tokens to download large volumes of data from Salesforce instances.</p><p>Salesforce, which has attempted to minimize the breachs severity by saying <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005134951&amp;type=1">a small number of customers</a> were affected, noted that when it detected the activity, it invalidated active Access and Refresh Tokens, and removed Drift from AppExchange. We then notified affected customers.</p><p>But according to Salesforce customer Cloudflare, the CDN giant saw the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/response-to-salesloft-drift-incident/">first signs</a> of reconnaissance related to the breach on Aug. 9, with an attacker gaining access to Cloudflares Salesforce tenant on Aug. 12. By Aug. 17, the attackers had analyzed Cloudflares Salesforce case workflows, derived insights into how Cloudflares team members handle various types of cases, and completed their exfiltration.</p><p>Three days later, on Aug. 20, Salesforce revoked Salesloft Drift connections and published its notice on its website. At that point, Cloudflare had not yet been notified, and we had no indication that this vendor action might relate to our environment, Cloudflares security leaders stated.</p><p>Cloudflare wasnt alone. Hundreds of companies were affected, including some of the biggest names in cybersecurity.</p><p><a href="https://www.mitiga.io/blog/shinyhunters-and-unc6395-inside-the-salesforce-and-salesloft-breaches">Mitiga Security researcher Idan Cohen wrote</a>: In the Drift case, customers werent careless. The attackers didnt hack their way in. They logged in, pretending to be a trusted third-party service.</p><p>This wasnt the only case involving breached Salesforce accounts. In June, a different group of attackers, known as ShinyHunters, <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4035701/we-too-were-breached-says-google-months-after-revealing-salesforce-attacks.html">pretended to be IT support personnel</a>, in order to trick users into approving a connection to a malicious version of Salesforces Data Loader application that then exfiltrated data from Salesforce environments.</p><p>Google, whose threat intelligence team described these attacks in a June report, itself fell victim to such an attack in August.</p><p>By October, <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4067846/extortion-gang-opens-data-leak-site-to-squeeze-victims-of-its-salesforce-attacks.html">attackers claimed to have stolen more than 1.5 billion Salesforce records</a> from 760 companies. They also launched an extortion campaign against Salesforce and its compromised enterprise customers, including Toyota, FedEx, Hulu, and UPS.</p><p>Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Salesforce, claiming the company didnt do enough to vet third-party applications connected to its systems, or to monitor for signs of data exfiltration and other malicious activity.</p><p>Salesforce  had the duty and ability to control its software environment and prevent these attacks from succeeding through implementation of security protocols that other companies in Salesforces industry regularly and routinely implement. But Salesforce did not, said one complaint in a <a href="https://mdlcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MDL-3164.pdf">class-action lawsuit</a> filed on Aug. 29 in California.</p><p>The potential for OAuth exploitation was a known risk and Salesforce failed to vet third-party connections, build protections, or monitor its networks against this kind of malicious activity, another group of class-action claimants said in a <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/filings/DM725Z2I/Johnson_v_Salesforce_Inc__candce-25-08011__0001.0.pdf">complaint</a> filed in September.</p><p>According to San Diego law firm CaseyGerry, there are now more than <a href="https://caseygerry.com/blog/salesforce-data-breach-lawsuit/">70 cases filed</a> across the country related to the Salesforce data breach.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-biggest-blind-spot">The biggest blind spot</h2><p>When companies delegate access to third parties via OAuth integrations, it creates a systemic security blind spot that spans all industries.</p><p>By stealing those tokens, attackers can gain access to all connected systems. Authorizing a malicious connected app bypasses many traditional defenses such as MFA, password resets and login monitoring, and because OAuth tokens are issued by Salesforce itself, activity coming from the malicious app can look like its from a trusted integration, the FBI <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2025/250912.pdf">warned</a> in an alert released in September.</p><p>The exploitation of such weaknesses is only going to get worse  especially as AI-related integrations increasingly become the norm.</p><p>Whereas a traditional CRM integration might need contact data, an AI sales assistant typically requires contacts, email histories, calendar information, deal pipeline data, conversation logs, and product catalogs, noted Trend Micro AI security expert Fernando Tucci in a report on why the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/ai-app-breach.html">breach of Salesloft Drift  an AI chatbot  hits differently</a>. This broader access pattern means a single compromised AI integration can expose significantly more sensitive information than traditional point solutions.</p><p>Worse, because AI chatbots are specifically designed to access large data sets, when a malicious actor piggybacks on the same connection to steal data, the traffic pattern can look legitimate.</p><p>Understanding all these partnerships and connections requires close coordination with vendor management, says Steve Winterfeld, advisory CISO at Akamai. Plus, understanding where your data is takes both culture-driven policies and technical controls, he says.</p><p>With white-labeled services, APIs, and now LLMs, these two goals are much more complex. If you havent conducted a supply chain breach exercise yet, now is the time, Winterfeld says. These recent events underscore the importance of validating your program.</p><p>Ironically, many security firms were among the victims, including Zscaler, Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, Pager Duty, SpyCloud, Tenable, Proofpoint, Rubrik, BeyondTrust, Bugcrowd, JFrog, CyberArk, and Black Duck.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="one-company-who-didnt-fall-victim">One company who didnt fall victim</h2><p>One company that wasnt scathed by the breaches was cloud-based IAM vendor Okta. Why? It allowed connections only from authorized IP addresses.</p><p><a href="https://www.okta.com/newsroom/articles/the-salesloft-incident--a-wake-up-call-for-saas-security-and-ips/">According to Okta</a>, when the company learned of the compromise, it immediately reviewed its logs and found attempts to access resources with stolen tokens  but those attempts failed.</p><p>The single most important control that prevented this breach was our enforcement of inbound IP restrictions, the company said. The threat actor attempted to use a compromised token to access our Salesforce instance, but the attack failed because the connection originated from an unauthorized IP address. This security layer proved essential, blocking the unauthorized attempt at the front door before any access could be gained.</p><p>This whitelisting approach to security is a powerful tactic, but its difficult to implement because it requires a great deal of discipline.</p><p>Another challenge is that not all SaaS vendors support this capability. Many providers in the cloud-first world do not offer this foundational security feature, creating a significant challenge for protecting interconnected systems, Okta said.</p><p>Foundational security benchmarks for SaaS providers are only now coming together, following the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4063383/cloud-security-alliance-launches-framework-to-improve-saas-security.html">Cloud Security Alliances recently launched SaaS Security Capability Framework (SSCF)</a>.</p><p>Okta noted that Salesforce already offers this functionality, but added that using it requires significant effort, given that restrictions have to be configured for APIs and users.</p><p>Another way to protect connections is to limit them to a specific client, using demonstrating proof of possession (DPoP), which prevents the reuse of stolen tokens, but this is even more difficult in practice because it requires changes to the authentication flow and adds new requirements for clients and servers. Another option is mutual TLS, which offers even stronger security, but at an even higher cost of complexity.</p><p>In the financial sector, for example, some regulators mandate DPoP or mTLS; while it isnt mandated in healthcare, theres a use case there as well, according to <a href="https://tyk.io/blog/demonstrating-proof-of-possession-dpop-oauth2-security-for-fapi-2-0-and-open-banking/">Tyk Technologies</a>.</p><p>More companies should be looking at upgrading this as their use of interconnected SaaS apps and AI tools increases.</p><p>The Internet Engineering Task Force <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700#name-sender-constrained-access-t">included</a> both DPoP and mTLS among its best practices for OAuth security.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="compounding-risk-going-forward">Compounding risk going forward</h2><p>When companies allow connections to systems outside their perimeter, they need to understand the risks they are assuming and the security controls available to them, Constellations Mehta says.</p><p>Even a control as straightforward and common as multi-factor authentication can be difficult to implement for all employees, he says.</p><p>From a solution provider perspective, they provide a specific set of security controls and features and its up to the customers to make sure they actually use them. In my view, it is a shared responsibility, Mehta says.</p><p>Shared responsibility for security was an important part of the message of last weeks Dreamforce, but discussion of the Salesloft incident was conspicuously missing a loss for attendees.</p><p>Because if anything can be taken away from the past few months of Salesforce-related cybersecurity, its that software supply-chain security is more important than ever. And it will only increase in importance as more systems get connected  a key tenet of <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4066640/salesforce-trusted-ai-foundation-provides-scaffolding-for-the-agentic-enterprise.html">Salesforces aim to power the agentic enterprise</a>.</p><p>Software supply-chain security is already not so easy to achieve, and, even as Salesforce promises to make this easier with the help of AI, it is AI itself that will make the problem that much harder to solve.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading">More <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3490106/salesforce-latest-news-and-insights.html">Salesforce news</a>:</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4071597/salesforce-updates-its-agentic-ai-pitch-with-agentforce-360.html">Salesforce updates its agentic AI pitch with Agentforce 360</a></li><li><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/4070540/lessons-from-the-salesforce-breach.html">Lessons from the Salesforce breach</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4069900/salesforce-brings-agentic-ai-to-it-service-management.html">Salesforce brings agentic AI to IT service management</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4046713/salesforce-ai-research-unveils-new-tools-for-ai-agents.html">Salesforce AI Research unveils new tools for AI agents</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>AI browsers can be abused by malicious AI sidebar extensions: Report</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>AI browsers may be smart, but theyre not smart enough to block a common threat: Malicious extensions.</p><p>Thats the conclusion of researchers at SquareX, who on Thursday <a href="https://labs.sqrx.com/ai-sidebar-spoofing-720e0c91d290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a report</a> showing how attackers can exploit AI sidebars through compromised browser extensions.</p><p>This attack vector isnt new. Malicious extensions have been <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4017474/verified-but-vulnerable-malicious-extensions-exploit-ide-trust-badges.html" target="_blank">inserted into browser web stores</a> to infect standard browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others for years.</p><p>What SquareX discovered are malicious extensions that can spoof the legitimate AI sidebars people use for queries. Their goal is to trick users into going to malicious websites, running data exfiltration commands, or installing backdoors. AI sidebar spoofing even works on the just-released OpenAI Atlas browser, SquareX says.</p><p>One solution for CISOs and CIOs is to ban the use of AI browsers, it suggests. That assumes the IT department can manage which browsers staff are using, particularly if they are allowed to use their own internet-connected devices. At the very least, IT must audit all extensions installed by employees for AI and non-AI browsers, the report says.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="treat-anything-ai-with-zero-trust-protocols">Treat anything AI with zero-trust protocols</h2><p>CISOs and CIOs need to treat anything AI with the strongest zero-trust protocols available, commented <a href="https://cypfer.com/team-member/ed-dubrovsky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ed Dubrovsky</a>, chief operating officer of incident response firm Cypfer, at least until some better functioning guardrails are established.</p><p>Establish a set of guardrails around AI use and functionality, he said, and if you are allowing AI vulnerable software into your corporate network, segment it into a place where it cant get into the Digital Crown Jewels, or even have an awareness of them.</p><p>He pointed out that AI is a completely different playing field, and CSOs are not yet prepared for it. The challenge is that IT leaders are trying to think of AI as a new tool or toolset and are trying to apply software development and maintenance methodologies to its management.</p><p>But in his view, AI is closer to I just hired 100 new employees with very little vetting or appropriate security controls, how do I secure my assets in case some of them are malicious?</p><p>AI is not only a language chatbot, but it also has agentic function where tasks are defined and deployed, and AI software can be written and deployed by AI, he said. This pushes the human away from the keyboard, in a way, and replaces it with a new software capability.</p><p>The risk is that AI is not, and likely never will be, completely foolproof, he added. There may come a day where AI will be powerful enough to avoid most human ability to fool it, but, he asked, can it avoid being manipulated by other AIs?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dumpster-fires">Dumpster fires</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/?originalSubdomain=ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Shipley</a>, head of Canadian employee security awareness training firm Beauceron Security, agrees.</p><p>I think if CISOs are bored and want to spice up their lives with an incident, they should roll out these AI-powered hot messes to their users, he said .</p><p>But, if theyre like most CISOs and they have lots of problems, but free time and boredom arent on that list, they should avoid these dumpster fires [AI browsers] at all costs.</p><p>Building and supporting a legitimate browser and extension ecosystem is difficult work, he argued, pointing out that even Apple, Google, and Microsoft still have issues.</p><p>I think its a mistake to think of the risk as just being about extensions, he added. Its the fundamental DNA of these browsers that is bad; the companies arent incented to pay enough attention to the problems, and bad extensions are just the straw that breaks cybersecuritys back.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>CISOs have a tough challenge: Its not hard to fool an employee into downloading and installing a malicious extension for any browser; browser extensions are supposed to be attractive add-on utilities such as password managers or AI productivity assistants. They are promoted in phishing and smishing messages, social media posts and, when threat actors are able, uploaded to marketplaces such as the Google Chrome Web Store. They can be malware disguised as a legitimate extension or can be a compromised version of one.</p><p>In AI Sidebar Spoofing, says the SquareX report, once a victim opens a new AI browser tab, the malicious extension injects JavaScript into the web page to create a fake sidebar that looks exactly like a legitimate sidebar. When the user enters a prompt into the spoofed sidebar, the extension hooks into its AI engine. But if the prompt requests certain instructions or guides, the responses can be manipulated to include additional instructions to the user. So, for example, if the user asks for good file sharing sites, the malicious extension might provide a link to the attackers file sharing site that requests high risk OAuth permissions that it can harvest. In the hands of a hacker, they could allow access to the victims email.</p><p>In one test, when a SquareX researcher asked a malicious sidebar extension how to install the Homebrew package manager for macOS or Linux, the instructions included an installation command line that executed a reverse shell command that would have connected the victims device to the attackers server. That would have given the attacker a system shell in which to execute commands on the victims machine.</p><p>Its critical that infosec leaders set granular browser-native policies that prevent users from carrying out malicious tasks as instructed by a fake AI sidebar, says the report. These would include a policy that blocks advanced phishing sites using advanced machine learning and page heuristic analysis, a policy that blocks high risk permissions from being granted to non-allowlisted apps, and a policy that warns users about and blocks copies of malicious/risky Linux commands.</p><p>The research is a warning shot for the early days of agentic browsing and [reminds users] that the implicit trust model of the UI needs rethinking, said <a href="https://www.exabeam.com/blog/incident-response/what-the-most-significant-government-collaboration-on-threat-detection-and-logging-got-right-and-wrong-and-what-you-should-know-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabrielle Hempel</a>, security operations strategist at Exabeam.</p><p>The main issue here is that agentic-AI browsers introduce an entirely new attack surface. This attack, a malicious extension injecting a fake AI sidebar overlay that looks like the real one, allows threat actors to hijack the trusted AI assistant UI and trick users into executing dangerous operations, she pointed out. Organizations need to be taking this seriously, because when you delegate browsing and actions to an AI sidebar, you are elevating what previously might have been a minor risk into a material risk to cloud assets, credentials, and devices.</p><p>IT leaders should restrict AI browser use for high-risk functions until they are proven secure, she advised, adding that, because the attack uses an extension with host and storage permissions, organizations should revisit their extension approval workflows for those as well. In fact, any productivity tool that requests broad access should require scrutiny. </p><p>Segmentation is also important once these tools are implemented: least privilege applies here and AI interaction with certain tabs/services should be limited, she said.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/4078274/ai-browsers-can-be-abused-by-malicious-ai-sidebar-extensions-report.html" target="_blank">Computerworld</a>.</em></p></div></div></div></div></p>
