			<h3>Samsungs image library flaw opens a zero-click backdoor</h3>
			<p>Samsung has disclosed a critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-21043, impacting libimagecodec.quram.so, a Samsung-specific image parsing library used across Android 13-16 devices. This out-of-bounds write vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) via specially crafted image files. Meta/WhatsApp privately reported the issue in August, highlighting messaging apps as a potential vector. The CVSS score of 8.8 indicates a high severity. Without patching, the flaw poses a significant risk, potentially enabling access to sensitive business apps, email accounts, and corporate data, especially within BYOD or mixed-managed environments. Organizations need to prioritize patching and implement robust mobile device management (MDM) strategies to mitigate this risk.</p>

			<h3>Cursor IDE: Arbitrary Data Exfiltration Via Mermaid (CVE-2025-54132)</h3>
			<p>A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-54132) was identified within the Cursor IDE, impacting its ability to render Mermaid diagrams. This flaw allows for unauthorized data exfiltration via the manipulation of the diagram&#39;s underlying graph data structure. Specifically, malicious actors can leverage the diagram rendering process to inject and subsequently exfiltrate sensitive information. Remediation involved a fix targeting the parsing of the Mermaid syntax and sanitization of the generated graph data, effectively mitigating the risk of this graph-based data exfiltration vector.</p>

			<h3>You will always remember this as the day you finally caught FamousSparrow</h3>
			<p>ESET threat researchers have identified and documented the attack chain employed by the FamousSparrow Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. This investigation revealed a suite of malware assets, including two previously uncharacterized iterations of the â€˜SparrowDoorâ€™ backdoor â€“ designated as Variants 1 and 2. Analysis of the artifacts indicates a sophisticated exploitation of known vulnerabilities, employing techniques such as lateral movement and command and control (C2) channel obfuscation. Further investigation is ongoing to assess the full scope of the group&#39;s activity and potential impact.</p>
