			<h3>Wrap Up: The Month of AI Bugs</h3>
			<p>This article summarizes a month-long investigation into vulnerabilities within various AI models, primarily focusing on prompt injection attacks. The research revealed multiple instances where attackers were able to exfiltrate sensitive data, including chat history, secrets, and execute arbitrary code through manipulated prompts. Specifically, vulnerabilities were identified in models such as ChatGPT, Claude, Amazon Q, and Google Jules, alongside related agents and tools, demonstrating the risk of indirect prompt injection and subsequent data breaches. The findings highlight the need for robust input validation and security controls when utilizing AI models.</p>
