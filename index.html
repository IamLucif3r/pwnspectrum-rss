			<h3>Scammers try to trick LastPass users into giving up credentials by telling them theyre dead</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Are you sure youre still alive? If so, you may fall for a phishing scam aimed at getting the master login passwords of LastPass password manager users.</p><p>OK, this sounds weird, but in some ways it isnt. If a person dies, their immediate family may not know how to get into the deceaseds password manager, and may contact the vendor asking for access. Scammers suspected of being part of theCryptoChameleon cyber criminal group are trying to take advantage of that by sending oddly-worded phishing messages to LastPass customers.</p><p>The goal, presumably, is not only to get LastPass login credentials, but also to access the users cryptocurrency wallet and drain its contents.</p><p>On Friday, LastPass <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/possible-cryptochameleon-social-engineering-campaign-targeting-lastpass-customers-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a warning to customers</a> about the phishing campaign, which began in the middle of this month, because the messages are spoofing the LastPass domain to appear to come from the company.</p><p>The subject line reads Legacy Request Opened (URGENT IF YOU ARE NOT DECEASED), and the message begins: A death certificate was uploaded by a family member to regain access to the LastPass account of &lt;victims name&gt;. If you have not passed away and you believe that this is a mistake, please reply to this email with Stop.</p><p>The email says that a support case has been opened to execute the request, and includes fabricated information regarding a supposed agent assigned to the case, including an agent ID number, the date the case opened, and the case priority.</p><p>It also includes a link to cancel the request, which in fact directs the intended victim to an attacker-controlled URL where the victim is asked to enter their LastPass master password, in an attempt to harvest their credentials.</p><p>The email concludes with the statement Your security is our top priority. Never share your master password with anyone  including us!</p><p>In some cases, a threat actor has also phoned people, claiming to be from LastPass and urging them to go to the phishing site and enter their master password.</p><p>In its alert, LastPass reminded users that it never asks for their master password.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-tricky-one-to-prevent">A tricky one to prevent</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Shipley</a>, head of Canadian-based employee security awareness firm Beauceron Security, called the pitch the most creative phishing lure hes seen this year.</p><p>Have to wonder if they used AI to come up with the concept, he added. </p><p>However, <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/author/roger-grimes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roger Grimes</a>, data-driven defense CISO advisor at KnowBe4, said its far from the oddest phishing lure hes seen; social engineering is involved in up to 90% of all successful hacks, he said in an email. </p><p>In this case, the social engineering hack was in convincing the user to download malware, he said. Thats a tricky one to prevent. I always tell people to learn the following and practice it religiously: If you receive an unexpected message asking you to do something youve never done before, at least for that sender, research the request using known trusted methods before performing. That will save you in 99% of social engineering scams, including this one.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="staff-should-be-using-mfa">Staff should be using MFA</h2><p>CSOs and IT managers should ensure that any password managers their employees use have phishing-resistant multifactor authentication or require an additional login factor, so if staff fall for a scam like this, the scammer cant log in just using stolen credentials, Grimes said.</p><p>If the corporate approved password manager doesnt allow MFA for logging into the app, it should have some additional login factor  for example, making the employee provide other confidential information that is far harder to obtain.</p><p>Combating phishing requests for password manager credentials requires a combination of user education and adding friction to the logins by requiring more than just the master password and MFA to access accounts or add new devices, said Shipley, who pointed out that some other password management providers require access to a secret key in addition to a master password to add access to a new device.</p><p>IT leaders should besending an e-mail blast to employees to let them know about the scam, linking to the LastPass blog, and encourage them to report any e-mails that look as though theyre coming from LastPass, he said.</p><p>The LastPass warning includes suspicious IP addresses and URLs as references for infosec leaders. It has taken down the initial phishing site.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="scam-going-after-a-broad-user-base">Scam going after a broad user base</h2><p>LastPass wouldnt disclose to <em>CSO</em> how many, if any, customers fell for this scam.</p><p>Asked if the campaign is targeting enterprise customers as well as consumers, a representative from the LastPass threat intelligence, mitigation and escalation team said it is targeting a broad user base.</p><p>CSOs and IT leaders should warn employees not to click on emails with the subject line Legacy Request Opened, the spokesperson said, and to report suspicious emails or phone calls claiming to be from LastPass.</p><p>According to the LastPass warning, the URL associated with this campaign has been linked by Google Threat Intelligence with the known cybercriminal group CryptoChameleon (also known as UNC5356). The group is associated with targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges and users with the intent to steal cryptocurrency. The group <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/advanced-phishing-kit-adds-lastpass-branding-for-use-in-phishing-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously leveraged LastPass as part of a phishing kit in April 2024</a>.</p><p>Other indicators of malicious behavior associated with this campaign, says LastPass, include the threat actors use of known bulletproof host NICENIC to host the phishing site, and the attempted direct social engineering, which are again consistent with previous CryptoChameleon behavior</p><p>In its advisory, the company also included the indicators of compromise, along with a list of URLs associated with the malicious IP addresses used by the attackers.</p><p>LastPass asks customers to forward any phishing emails or screen captures of texts that are targeting its products to abuse@lastpass.com.</p><p><em>This article first appeared on <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/4078994/scammers-try-to-trick-lastpass-users-into-giving-up-credentials-by-telling-them-theyre-dead.html" target="_blank">Computerworld</a>.</em></p></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>AI browsers can be abused by malicious AI sidebar extensions: Report</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>AI browsers may be smart, but theyre not smart enough to block a common threat: Malicious extensions.</p><p>Thats the conclusion of researchers at SquareX, who on Thursday <a href="https://labs.sqrx.com/ai-sidebar-spoofing-720e0c91d290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a report</a> showing how attackers can exploit AI sidebars through compromised browser extensions.</p><p>This attack vector isnt new. Malicious extensions have been <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4017474/verified-but-vulnerable-malicious-extensions-exploit-ide-trust-badges.html" target="_blank">inserted into browser web stores</a> to infect standard browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and others for years.</p><p>What SquareX discovered are malicious extensions that can spoof the legitimate AI sidebars people use for queries. Their goal is to trick users into going to malicious websites, running data exfiltration commands, or installing backdoors. AI sidebar spoofing even works on the just-released OpenAI Atlas browser, SquareX says.</p><p>One solution for CISOs and CIOs is to ban the use of AI browsers, it suggests. That assumes the IT department can manage which browsers staff are using, particularly if they are allowed to use their own internet-connected devices. At the very least, IT must audit all extensions installed by employees for AI and non-AI browsers, the report says.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="treat-anything-ai-with-zero-trust-protocols">Treat anything AI with zero-trust protocols</h2><p>CISOs and CIOs need to treat anything AI with the strongest zero-trust protocols available, commented <a href="https://cypfer.com/team-member/ed-dubrovsky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ed Dubrovsky</a>, chief operating officer of incident response firm Cypfer, at least until some better functioning guardrails are established.</p><p>Establish a set of guardrails around AI use and functionality, he said, and if you are allowing AI vulnerable software into your corporate network, segment it into a place where it cant get into the Digital Crown Jewels, or even have an awareness of them.</p><p>He pointed out that AI is a completely different playing field, and CSOs are not yet prepared for it. The challenge is that IT leaders are trying to think of AI as a new tool or toolset and are trying to apply software development and maintenance methodologies to its management.</p><p>But in his view, AI is closer to I just hired 100 new employees with very little vetting or appropriate security controls, how do I secure my assets in case some of them are malicious?</p><p>AI is not only a language chatbot, but it also has agentic function where tasks are defined and deployed, and AI software can be written and deployed by AI, he said. This pushes the human away from the keyboard, in a way, and replaces it with a new software capability.</p><p>The risk is that AI is not, and likely never will be, completely foolproof, he added. There may come a day where AI will be powerful enough to avoid most human ability to fool it, but, he asked, can it avoid being manipulated by other AIs?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dumpster-fires">Dumpster fires</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/?originalSubdomain=ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Shipley</a>, head of Canadian employee security awareness training firm Beauceron Security, agrees.</p><p>I think if CISOs are bored and want to spice up their lives with an incident, they should roll out these AI-powered hot messes to their users, he said .</p><p>But, if theyre like most CISOs and they have lots of problems, but free time and boredom arent on that list, they should avoid these dumpster fires [AI browsers] at all costs.</p><p>Building and supporting a legitimate browser and extension ecosystem is difficult work, he argued, pointing out that even Apple, Google, and Microsoft still have issues.</p><p>I think its a mistake to think of the risk as just being about extensions, he added. Its the fundamental DNA of these browsers that is bad; the companies arent incented to pay enough attention to the problems, and bad extensions are just the straw that breaks cybersecuritys back.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>CISOs have a tough challenge: Its not hard to fool an employee into downloading and installing a malicious extension for any browser; browser extensions are supposed to be attractive add-on utilities such as password managers or AI productivity assistants. They are promoted in phishing and smishing messages, social media posts and, when threat actors are able, uploaded to marketplaces such as the Google Chrome Web Store. They can be malware disguised as a legitimate extension or can be a compromised version of one.</p><p>In AI Sidebar Spoofing, says the SquareX report, once a victim opens a new AI browser tab, the malicious extension injects JavaScript into the web page to create a fake sidebar that looks exactly like a legitimate sidebar. When the user enters a prompt into the spoofed sidebar, the extension hooks into its AI engine. But if the prompt requests certain instructions or guides, the responses can be manipulated to include additional instructions to the user. So, for example, if the user asks for good file sharing sites, the malicious extension might provide a link to the attackers file sharing site that requests high risk OAuth permissions that it can harvest. In the hands of a hacker, they could allow access to the victims email.</p><p>In one test, when a SquareX researcher asked a malicious sidebar extension how to install the Homebrew package manager for macOS or Linux, the instructions included an installation command line that executed a reverse shell command that would have connected the victims device to the attackers server. That would have given the attacker a system shell in which to execute commands on the victims machine.</p><p>Its critical that infosec leaders set granular browser-native policies that prevent users from carrying out malicious tasks as instructed by a fake AI sidebar, says the report. These would include a policy that blocks advanced phishing sites using advanced machine learning and page heuristic analysis, a policy that blocks high risk permissions from being granted to non-allowlisted apps, and a policy that warns users about and blocks copies of malicious/risky Linux commands.</p><p>The research is a warning shot for the early days of agentic browsing and [reminds users] that the implicit trust model of the UI needs rethinking, said <a href="https://www.exabeam.com/blog/incident-response/what-the-most-significant-government-collaboration-on-threat-detection-and-logging-got-right-and-wrong-and-what-you-should-know-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabrielle Hempel</a>, security operations strategist at Exabeam.</p><p>The main issue here is that agentic-AI browsers introduce an entirely new attack surface. This attack, a malicious extension injecting a fake AI sidebar overlay that looks like the real one, allows threat actors to hijack the trusted AI assistant UI and trick users into executing dangerous operations, she pointed out. Organizations need to be taking this seriously, because when you delegate browsing and actions to an AI sidebar, you are elevating what previously might have been a minor risk into a material risk to cloud assets, credentials, and devices.</p><p>IT leaders should restrict AI browser use for high-risk functions until they are proven secure, she advised, adding that, because the attack uses an extension with host and storage permissions, organizations should revisit their extension approval workflows for those as well. In fact, any productivity tool that requests broad access should require scrutiny. </p><p>Segmentation is also important once these tools are implemented: least privilege applies here and AI interaction with certain tabs/services should be limited, she said.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/4078274/ai-browsers-can-be-abused-by-malicious-ai-sidebar-extensions-report.html" target="_blank">Computerworld</a>.</em></p></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>Critical Microsoft WSUS flaw exploited in wild after insufficient patch</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Microsoft released out-of-band patches on Thursday to comprehensively fix a critical vulnerability in the Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) after the first patches released on Oct. 14 proved insufficient. Attackers exploited the vulnerability in the wild after a detailed vulnerability analysis and proof-of-concept exploit were published this week.</p><p>Tracked as CVE-2025-59287, the vulnerability stems from an unsafe deserialization of the AuthorizationCookie object in WSUS environments. Successful exploitation enables remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.</p><p>WSUS is commonly used in enterprise environments to deliver Microsoft updates to Windows systems in a controlled manner. The service is not enabled by default on Windows servers but can be turned on by enabling the WSUS Server Role.</p><p>Microsoft included a patch for CVE-2025-59287 in its <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072485/october-2025-patch-tuesday-holes-in-windows-server-update-service-and-an-ancient-modem-driver.html">October Patch Tuesday release on Oct. 14</a>. But the initial fix was apparently not complete and required a new round of updates for Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2022 (23H2 Edition, Server Core installation), and Windows Server 2025.</p><p>According to the companys <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59287">updated advisory</a>, organizations should deploy these updates as soon as possible. Work-arounds include disabling the WSUS Server Role or blocking inbound traffic to ports 8530 and 8531, but both these actions will render the service non-operational until the patches can be deployed.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attacks-observed-in-the-wild">Attacks observed in the wild</h2><p>Microsofts advisory doesnt mention in-the-wild exploitation, but researchers from cybersecurity firm Huntress and <a href="https://advisories.ncsc.nl/2025/ncsc-2025-0310.html">the Dutch governments National Cybersecurity Center</a> separately reported evidence of attacks. This came after a detailed analysis and proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw <a href="https://hawktrace.com/blog/CVE-2025-59287-UNAUTH">was posted by researchers from cybersecurity firm HawkTrace</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>Starting around 2025-10-23 23:34 UTC, Huntress observed threat actors targeting WSUS instances publicly exposed on their default ports (8530/TCP and 8531/TCP), the company wrote in <a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/exploitation-of-windows-server-update-services-remote-code-execution-vulnerability">a blog post</a> Friday. Attackers leveraged exposed WSUS endpoints to send specially crafted requests (multiple POST calls to WSUS web services) that triggered a deserialization RCE against the update service.</p><p>The exploit activity resulted in the WSUS worker process spawning command prompt and PowerShell instances. A base64-encoded payload was downloaded and executed in PowerShell with the goal of discovering servers on the network and gathering user information which was then sent back to a remote attacker-controlled URL.</p><p>The Huntress report includes detailed indicators of compromise, forensic artifacts, and detection rules in the open Sigma SIEM detection format.</p></div></div></div></div></p>

Firstly, <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3838121/the-dirty-dozen-12-worst-ransomware-groups-active-today.html">ransomware operators</a> vary significantly in sophistication. Whilst established groups like LockBit or ALPHV typically provide functional decryptors, as they have a reputation to maintain, smaller operations often deploy flawed encryption implementations or simply disappear after payment.</p><p>Decryptors are frequently slow and unreliable, John adds.</p><p>Large-scale decryption across enterprise environments can take weeks and often fails on corrupted files or complex database systems, he explains. Cases exist where the decryption process itself causes additional data corruption.</p><p>Even when decryptor tools are supplied, they may contain bugs, or leave files corrupted or inaccessible. Many organizations also rely on untested  and vulnerable  backups. Making matters still worse, many ransomware victims discover that their backups were also encrypted as part of the attack.</p><p>Criminals often use flawed or incompatible encryption tools, and many businesses lack the infrastructure to restore data cleanly, especially if backups are patchy or systems are still compromised, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darylflack/?originalSubdomain=uk">Daryl Flack</a>, partner at UK-based managed security provider Avella Security and cybersecurity advisor to the UK Government.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="additional-recovery-pressures">Additional recovery pressures</h2><p>Modern ransomware attacks now routinely involve double or triple extortion whereby attackers <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4032874/ransomware-attacks-the-evolving-extortion-threat-to-us-financial-institutions.html">threaten to leak stolen data</a> or launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks even after payment.</p><p>This fundamentally changes the calculus on what victims can expect in cases where they decide to make a ransomware payment, which more often than not fails to resolve many of the problems arising from a ransomware attack.</p><p>Paying only addresses the encryption element, not the broader compromise, Bridewells John notes.</p><p>Moreover, a ransomware incident puts an organization under enormous pressure, with legal, operational, and reputational issues all converging, <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3825444/ransomware-gangs-extort-victims-17-hours-after-intrusion-on-average.html">often within a matter of hours</a>.</p><p>These factors, combined with the inherent uncertainty of dealing with criminals, help explain why paying the ransom so often falls short of achieving full data recovery.</p><p><a href="https://harperjames.co.uk/our-people/lillian-tsang/">Lillian Tsang</a>, senior solicitor in Harper James data protection and privacy team, warns that even when a decryption key is received, some data may already be permanently damaged, altered, or stolen.</p><p>That creates operational challenges but also raises data protection concerns, particularly where personal data is involved, Tsang explains. If records are lost or compromised, this can amount to a personal data breach under UK GDPR, which brings reporting obligations and the potential for regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Paying a ransom doesnt give a business any legal recourse if the criminals fail to deliver and, worse, payment can create further risk if funds are unknowingly transferred to a sanctioned group, Tsang warns.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="financial-resilience-and-legal-issues">Financial resilience and legal issues</h2><p>How a ransomware attack plays out in practice is illustrated by an account from an executive at Kantsu, a midsize Japanese logistics company. Kantsu President Hisahiro Tatsujo <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4036296/%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E6%94%BB%E6%92%83%E3%81%AB%E3%81%95%E3%82%89%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%9F%E4%BC%81%E6%A5%AD%E7%B5%8C%E5%96%B6%E8%80%85%E3%81%8C%E8%AA%9E%E3%82%8B%E5%AF%BE%E5%BF%9C.html">told CIO.com about the companys efforts to restore operations following a ransomware attack</a>.</p><p>Kantsu  which did not pay a ransomware  was obliged to ask financial institutions for loans to cover the cost of recovering its operations because, although it was insured, its insurance firm had to go through a claims process before making a payout. The incident illustrated how enterprises need a financial as well as an operational plan to successfully recover from ransomware attacks.</p><p>Moreover, when systems are disrupted by ransomware attacks, legal obligations kick in almost immediately with requirements to notify regulators and affected individuals, especially if personal data is affected by a breach.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges is making rapid, high-stakes decisions with only fragments of information, says Harper James Tsang. Senior leaders have to weigh the legal risks of payment, the impact on business continuity, and the potential consequences for individuals, often with limited technical clarity.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="forewarned-is-forearmed">Forewarned is forearmed</h2><p>Some experts advise maintaining a retainer with an incident response firm as part of <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/515730/business-continuity-and-disaster-recovery-planning-the-basics.html">disaster recovery plans</a> that anticipate the all-too-real possibility of a ransomware attack.</p><p>Having a retainer with a reputable incident response or negotiation firm  one equipped to handle cryptocurrency transactions  is crucial, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremysamide/">Jeremy Samide</a>, CEO at Blackwired, a cybersec company focused on direct threat intelligence. Such firms manage <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3568817/the-ransomware-negotiation-playbook-adds-new-chapters.html">negotiations</a>, have access to multiple crypto types (e.g., Bitcoin, Monero, Zcash), and can execute transfers securely if payment becomes the only path to recovery.</p><p>Samide adds: Preparation doesnt mean capitulation  it means being ready for every scenario.</p><p>Harper James Tsang cautions against setting aside funds to pay criminals in the event of ransomware attacks.</p><p>Setting aside funds to pay a ransom is increasingly viewed as problematic, Tsang says. While payment isnt illegal in itself, it may breach sanctions, it can fuel further criminal activity, and there is no guarantee of a positive outcome.</p><p>A more secure legal and strategic position comes from investing in resilience through strong security measures, well-tested recovery plans, clear reporting protocols, and cyber insurance, Tsang advises.</p><p>Cyber insurance is crucial for ransomware attacks because not only does it provide financial protection, but it can also give organizations access to specialized support that can significantly reduce damage and downtime, Tsang explains.</p><p><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/571703/cyber-insurance-explained.html">Cyber insurance</a> policies often offer active crisis management, with provisions that can cover:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Immediate incident response and forensic investigation</li><li>Containment and remediation of infected systems</li><li>Negotiation and legal coordination with attackers</li><li>Data recovery and business continuity support</li></ul><p>Insurance cant prevent an attack  but it can soften the blow, bring structure to chaos, and ensure that organizations dont navigate ransomware crises alone, says Blackwireds Samide.</p><p>But cyber insurance still comes with caveats, other experts caution.</p><p>Insurance premiums are rising, and insurers now expect a stronger baseline of cybersecurity measures  multi-factor authentication, patch management, and tested backups  before offering or renewing coverage, says Avella Securitys Flack. This shift encourages organizations to adopt better security practices as part of their risk management approach.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cyber-recovery">Cyber recovery</h2><p>Cyber recovery following a ransomware attack needs to be treated similarly to disaster recovery with a fully defined, in-house recovery plan, fully documented, where uncompromised data can be restored confidently, experts advise.</p><p>When enterprises are hit by ransomware, one of the first and most pressing challenges is assessing the full scope of the attack  identifying which data has been compromised, which systems are affected, and whether existing backups can be trusted, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcgann/">Jim McGann</a>, CMO at Index Engines, explains. Even when backups are available, verifying their integrity is a major hurdle, as they may contain corrupted or altered files that could reintroduce the threat during recovery.</p><p>Enterprises now need in-house recovery plans that include forensic-level data validation of data, not just restoration, McGann advises.</p></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>UN agreement on cybercrime criticized over risks to cybersecurity researchers</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Cybersecurity researchers could face criminal charges for performing their legitimate work if the <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/convention/text/convention-full-text.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Nations Convention against Cybercrime</a> is ratified in a process beginning in Hanoi, Vietnam, this weekend, critics say.</p><p>Tech industry group <a href="https://cybertechaccord.org/signatories/">Cybersecurity Tech Accord</a> said today that little has changed since it presented <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/Cybercrime/AdHocCommittee/Concluding_session/Submissions/Multi-Stakeholders/Cybersecurity_Tech_Accord_-_7th_AHC_session_submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a detailed critique of the UN Convention against Cybercrime</a> more than a year ago.</p><p>The group, comprising tech heavyweights Arm, Cisco, Cloudflare, Dell, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, and over 100 others, warned that the convention opens the door to criminalization of legitimate online activities, as well as making fighting cybercrime more difficult.</p><p>The Accord said the Convention had an unclear and overly broad scope, vague criminalization provisions, missing protections for cybersecurity researchers, unnecessarily expansive data access provisions, and intrusive surveillance powers with no meaningful safeguards to protect individuals and victims of cybercrime from arbitrary abuse of executive authority. As a result, it said, the latest draft reads more like a UN digital surveillance treaty than a targeted instrument to fight cybercrime.</p><p>Consequently, it urged UN member-states not to ratify the Convention when the process begins this weekend.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-researchers-at-risk">Security researchers at risk</h2><p>Human Rights Watch, an organization that investigates and reports on abuses worldwide, is also opposed to the Convention. In a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/30/new-un-cybercrime-treaty-primed-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post shortly after the UN adopted the Convention</a>, it said that the treaty extends far beyond cybercrime to require states to establish broad electronic surveillance powers without adequate human rights safeguards.</p><p>The convention will obligate governments to collect electronic evidence and share it with foreign authorities for any serious crime, defined as an offense punishable by at least four years of imprisonment under domestic law, wrote Deputy Director, Technology, Rights &amp; Investigations, Deborah Brown, noting that many governments treat activities such as investigative journalism and the ordinary activities of security researchers as criminal offenses.</p><p>The Human Rights Research Center is one of numerous other groups warning against the Convention. The poor drafting of the UN Cybercrime Treaty demonstrates that a minimum threshold for activities constituting a cybercrime has not been established, illustrating a problematic line that Member States need to walk in upholding national and international justice, it warned <a href="https://www.humanrightsresearch.org/post/the-un-cybercrime-treaty-a-pandora-s-box-for-human-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a March 2025 post</a>.</p><p>However, <a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/valence-howden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valence Howden</a>, an advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, said that the Convention had improved during the drafting process, particularly around the definition of what actions constitute cybercrimes.</p><p>The current text of the agreement focused a lot more on ensuring that the action was taken with the intent to be malicious, so I see a lot of value in this moving forward, he said. I dont believe its perfect, and we may need a bit more explicit protection for individuals who arent doing things with malicious intent. However, I believe the urge to make it hyper-specific will also allow nitpicking that will work to prevent this from moving forward at all. That approach favors the powerful companies and protects potential criminality on their part in accessing and leveraging data for AI.</p><p>But, he added, We need to see and understand the signatories and understand how they implement, because there is flexibility (read as vagueness) in the treaty. Much like global standards, it has to allow for flexibility to account for the variable approaches of different countries and regions. I suspect the debate that its driven by is beneficial as well.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Shipley</a>, CEO of Beauceron Security, also applauded facets of the Convention.</p><p>The good news here is that after five long years of negotiation, certain basics like making sure countries that sign on and ratify this treaty all have criminal laws on the books for various digital crimes consistently is a huge win, he said, recalling a case he assisted in where the perpetrator of a series of non-consensual intimate image distributions fled the country to a region where the act was not considered a crime.</p><p>In this scenario, if this convention was in effect, if the country the suspect had fled to had signed on, they would have been required to treat what happened as a crime and hopefully would have cooperated in the investigatation and prosecution of the perpetrator, he said. And the victim may have had some measure of justice. Instead, they were left only with the trauma of what happened to them.</p><p>He is pleased that the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071954/eu-to-sign-un-convention-on-cybercrime.html">European Union has decided to support the treaty</a>, since it takes cybercrime seriously while still protecting the fundamental privacy and human rights of its citizens. However, he noted, I think the key here is to remember each member state has to not just sign on, but has to ratify this treaty in their government and pass or amend laws as required. This is going to take quite some time. As well, nothing in this treaty compromises the judicial or policing processes, so if an authoritarian regime attempts to abuse this convention, western liberal democracies with strong foundations in the rule of law will have checks and balances.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="better-budapest-than-hanoi">Better Budapest than Hanoi?</h2><p>However, the Cybersecurity Tech Accords <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashtonhart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Ashton-Hart</a>, who headed the groups delegation to the UN committee creating the treaty, said that rather than implementing the Convention against Cybercrime, UN member states should look to another agreement: the Council of Europes <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Budapest Convention</a>. It, he said, is a much better agreement that is already in force with a critical mass of member-states as parties, a growing list of states who want to join it, a proven track record, and extensive guidance in how to address the Convention in a rights respecting way.</p><p>He added, I expect that the private sector will continue to focus its efforts on capacity building and technical assistance for Budapest and wont prioritize the UN Convention  unless the protocol negotiations [described in Articles 61 and 62 of the Convention] address its problems.</p><p>Despite these problems, Shipley thinks that the industry should now focus on proper implementation of the Convention.</p><p>I understand the concerns that the cybersecurity industry has raised, he said. Theyre not at the idea of greater cooperation in taking down gangs. Theyre aimed at the conventions ambiguous language around unauthorized access and the potential for security researchers to be caught in the crosshairs for doing ethical research. But that ship has sailed and wed be better off ensuring the application of the convention within states that choose to sign on, does include robust protections for security research.</p><p>The Convention will come into force 90 days after it has been ratified by 40 member states or regional economic integration organizations; the ratification process extends until December 31, 2026.</p></div></div></div></div></p>

According to ESET researchers, defenders in the aerospace and UAV supply chain should ingest these IoCs, tune detections for the listed TTPs, and apply the containment and hunting steps.</p></div></div></div></div></p>
