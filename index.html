			<h3>Atlas browser exploit lets attackers hijack ChatGPT memory</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>Days after cybersecurity analysts <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/4078115/enterprises-should-not-install-openais-new-atlas-browser-analysts-warn.html" target="_blank">warned</a> enterprises against installing OpenAIs new Atlas browser, researchers have discovered a vulnerability that allows attackers to infect systems with malicious code, granting themselves access privileges, or deploy malware. The development raises immediate questions about the enterprise readiness of AI-native browsers.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/4077980/has-openai-shown-us-a-future-for-safari.html?utm=hybrid_search">Atlas</a> browser has come under scrutiny after researchers at LayerX Security revealed that attackers could exploit the flaw to inject malicious instructions directly into a users ChatGPT memory and potentially execute remote code.</p><p>To prevent attackers from exploiting the vulnerability, LayerX has reported the exploit to OpenAI without sharing any additional technical information.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-exploitation-works">How the exploitation works</h2><p>The exploit works in five steps. In the first step, a user logs in to ChatGPT, and an authentication cookie or token is held in their browser. In the next step, the user clicks on a malicious link that leads them to a compromised web page, Or Eshed, co-founder and CEO of LayerX, <a href="https://layerxsecurity.com/blog/layerx-identifies-vulnerability-in-new-chatgpt-atlas-browser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> in a blog post.</p><p>In the next step, the malicious page invokes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/520886/application-security-threat-watch-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf.html?utm=hybrid_search">CSRF</a>) request to take advantage of the users pre-existing authentication into ChatGPT. In the fourth step, the CSRF exploit then injects hidden instructions into ChatGPTs memory, without the users knowledge, thereby tainting the core LLM memory.</p><p>In the fifth step, the tainted memories are invoked when the user queries ChatGPT, allowing deployment of malicious code that can give attackers control over systems or code.</p><p>ChatGPTs <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1611984/chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-did-last-summer.html?utm=hybrid_search">memory</a> is a useful tool designed for the AI chatbot to remember details such as users queries, chat, and activities, preferences, style notes, and respond with personalized and relevant information.</p><p>Memory is accountlevel and persists across sessions, browsers, and devices, so a single successful lure follows the user from home to office and from personal to corporate contexts, said <a href="https://ankura.com/experts-and-advisors/amit-jaju" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amit Jaju</a>, global partner/senior managing director  India at Ankura Consulting. In BYOD or mixeduse environments, that persistence retriggers risky behaviors even after a reboot or browser change, expanding blast radius beyond a single endpoint. This is especially concerning where personal ChatGPT accounts are used for work tasks.</p><p>Jaju added that adoption inside enterprises is currently very low. Atlas just launched, is macOSonly, and enterprise access is off by default. So, exposure is limited to pilots and unsanctioned installations. But business workspaces have it available by default, so spillover into work use is plausible.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-detect-a-hit">How to detect a hit</h2><p>Detecting a memory-based compromise in ChatGPT Atlas is not like hunting for traditional malware. There are no files, registry keys, or executables to isolate. Instead, security teams need to look for behavioral anomalies such as subtle shifts in how the assistant responds, what it suggests, and when it does so.</p><p>There are clues, but they sit outside the usual stack. For example, an assistant that suddenly starts offering scripts with outbound URLs, or one that begins anticipating user intent too accurately, may be relying on injected memory entries. When memory is compromised, the AI can act with unearned context. That should be a red flag, said <a href="https://greyhoundresearch.com/svg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanchit Vir Gogia</a>, CEO and chief analyst at Greyhound Research.</p><p>He added, from a forensic perspective, analysts need to pivot toward correlating browser logs, memory change timestamps, and prompt-response sequences. Exporting and parsing chat history is essential. SOC teams should pay close attention to sequences where users clicked on unknown links followed by unusual memory updates or AI-driven agent actions.</p><p>As this is not a plug-and-play detection problem, redemption and mitigation start with keeping Atlas disabled for the enterprise by default. In Business, it should be confined to tightly scoped pilots with nonsensitive data.</p><p>Jaju added that for monitoring, enterprises should add detections for AIsuggested code, fetching remote payloads, unusual egress after ChatGPT usage, and sessionriding behaviors in SaaS. He also suggested enabling web filtering on newly registered or uncategorized domains.</p><p>The moment an Atlas users memory is compromised, the threat resides in the cloud-bound identity, not in any one machine. That is why the response must start with the account. Memory must be cleared. Credentials should be rotated. All recent chat history should be reviewed for signs of tampering, hidden logic, or manipulated task flow, noted Gogia.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="are-ai-browsers-safe">Are AI browsers safe?</h2><p>Along with identifying the vulnerability, LayerX <a href="https://layerxsecurity.com/blog/layerx-finds-that-perplexitys-comet-browser-is-up-to-85-more-vulnerable-to-phishing-and-web-attacks-than-chrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that ChatGPT Atlas is also not equipped to stop phishing attacks. In the tests conducted by the company, ChatGPT Atlas had a failure rate of over 94%. Of the total 103 in-the-wild attacks, 97 attacks went through successfully.</p><p>The results were not very promising for other AI browsers, which the company tested last month. Perplexitys Comet and Genspark were only able to stopped only 7% phishing attacks, while only Arc browsers Dia was able to stop around 46% attacks. The traditional browsers, such as Edge and Chrome, on the other hand, are relatively well equipped and were able to stop about 50% of phishing attacks using their out-of-the-box protections.</p></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>Is your perimeter having an identity crisis?</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>For years, youve operated on a fundamental and fragile assumption that with enough training and the right tools, you could trust your employees to be the first line of defense. You taught them to spot the typos in phishing emails, to hover over suspicious links, to question the unusual requests and to report anything suspicious. However, the nature of identity, the bedrock of security models, is being systematically challenged.</p><p>Youre now living in a world of digital doppelgangers, enhanced by the emergence of gen-AI and fueled by the terabytes of personal data siphoned from countless security breaches. The threat is no longer just a well-crafted email. Threats can now speak with the voice of your CFO, write with the syntax of your Head of Legal and potentially send text messages that reference real and recent conversations.</p><p>Your digital life, including your employment history, your personal anecdotes from social media and your highly sensitive data, can become the raw material for your own malicious digital doppelgangers.</p><p>Consider the recent wave of business email compromise attacks where attackers used <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-generated voice messages to authorize fraudulent wire transfers</a>. Or the sophisticated campaigns where <a href="https://abnormal.ai/blog/bec-vec-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threat actors scraped social media profiles </a>to create messages that reference colleagues by name or recent company projects. These arent isolated incidents; they represent a serious shift in how attackers operate, with a much lower barrier to entry.</p><p>What once required advanced technical skills and extensive investigating can now be achieved by anyone with access to widely available AI tools and the time to probe through public data about an individual, AKA: their target.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-ai-is-automating-impersonation">How AI is automating impersonation</h2><p>Threat actors are not just automating attacks; they are automating impersonation by leveraging AI to:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Craft phishing, smishing and vishing.</strong> Creating hyper-personalized emails that can be grammatically perfect, contextually aware and emotionally resonant. These messages no longer demonstrate the telltale signs of traditional phishing like broken English or generic greetings.</li><li><strong>Synthesize trust.</strong> Using voice-cloning AI to leave a quick, urgent voicemail from a trusted executive, bypassing the skepticism youve trained into your employees.</li><li><strong>Orchestrate multi-channel attacks.</strong> An attack might start with a benign-looking text, be followed up by a seemingly legitimate email and culminate in a phone call that seals the deal. Each step reinforces the fabricated identity.</li><li><strong>Exploit contextual awareness.</strong> With access to your data, AI can now analyze your communication patterns, typical working hours, frequent contacts and even your writing style to create messages that feel authentically you. They can reference recent meetings, ongoing projects or shared experiences scraped from internal communications or social platforms.</li></ul><p>These capabilities arent theoretical  theyre operational today.</p><p>The result is a severe identity crisis, not just for your employees, but for your infrastructure. When an attacker can convincingly mimic a trusted identity, your traditional defenses can begin to look alarmingly thin. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is critical, but what happens if the user is socially engineered into approving the push notification? Network segmentation is essential, but what if illegitimate credentials traverse those segments and are considered legitimate?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-security-mandate-default-to-distrust">Your security mandate, default to distrust</h2><p>This requires a fundamental mindset shift. Your mandate must be <strong>Never trust, always verify. </strong>Your strategy must now pivot to a more dynamic, intelligent and identity-centric model:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Assume compromise.</strong> You should operate as if the initial point of entry has already been breached. Your focus should shift from solely prevention to rapid detection and response as well. Its no longer just about keeping them out; its about finding them the second theyre in.</li><li><strong>Radical visibility.</strong> You cannot fight an enemy you cannot see. You need unified visibility across every touchpoint, from the endpoint to the network core, from the cloud instance to the mobile device. You need to see not just traffic, but behavior. Is this user acting like the real person? Why is the CFO suddenly accessing files from an anomalous geolocation at 3 am?</li><li><strong>Modernize authentication.</strong> Organizations should aggressively move towards phishing-resistant authentication methods like <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FIDO2</a>, which can help make it harder to steal the keys to the kingdom.</li><li><strong>Harness intelligence.</strong> Leverage threat intelligence that is broad, deep and predictive. As I know from my own organizations work on the annual <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:vbg:intl:UKResourcesDBIR&amp;ds_cid=22031141982_ds_agid=173907107004&amp;utm_medium=knc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=BNDUKUnlimited&amp;utm_term=verizon%20dbir&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22031141982&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4nhFGexbrYU4jXD0iFT1gzW3fI3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw3OjGBhDYARIsADd-uX7gdqmy6BfVfxclnFH0gGpI7oV2haT4NO43-9sV-NradJA3XZFyepQaAvX3EALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verizon Business Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)</a>, understanding the overarching tactics and techniques of your adversaries is paramount to building a defense that anticipates, rather than just reacts.</li></ul><p>This identity crisis is a defining challenge of your generation of security leaders. You are no longer just protecting data; you are defending the concept of legitimate identity against an autonomous, tireless adversary. The path forward requires the courage to fight AI with AI and the vision to build resilient, identity-first security frameworks.</p><p>And just as you began to grapple with this, the next evolution is already looming: Agentic AI  autonomous systems capable of independent reasoning and decision-making.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-next-frontier-agentic-ai">The next frontier: Agentic AI</h2><p>Current generative AI models require a human operator, and they can generate a flawless email or clone a voice on command. Agentic AI has the potential to become an almost-independent threat actor. Given a simple goal, agentic agents can independently reason, plan and execute the complex, multi-step attack required to achieve malicious goals. This autonomous threat actor can operate 24/7, adapt to obstacles in near real-time and scale its operations with terrifying efficiency. Human defenders are now against agentic threat actors that do not sleep and can execute a sophisticated campaign at a speed and scale you have never witnessed before.</p><p>So the question you must all now ask yourself is not if your employees will be targeted by a digital doppelgnger, but how quickly you will be able to tell the difference.</p><p>As you prepare to defend against malicious AI agents, you must also consider the security implications of deploying your own. This requires applying a familiar security principle: the principle of least privilege. You wouldnt give a new employee the keys to the entire kingdom, and the same logic must apply to AI. An agents access to networks and data must be strictly circumscribed by its role and context, operating within a well-defined hierarchy.</p><p>Implementing secure agentic AI requires establishing clear guardrails from the outset. Assign explicit limitations for each agent. Establish a process that can enable an immediate shutdown if agents begin operating outside defined parameters. Monitor and log every action, allowing for close reviews of any unusual behaviors. Most critically, maintain close human oversight over agent patterns and outcomes  with feedback loops that allow your security team to identify when there may be manipulation at play or when decision-making processes yield unexpected results.</p><p>Ultimately, just as you train your human teams to recognize and resist social engineering, you must continuously test the resilience of your AI agents. This is where red teaming becomes critical, not just for your infrastructure, but for your own autonomous systems, helping to verify that they cannot be tricked by an adversary.</p><p>Organizations that can strike this balance will be best positioned to both secure and defend against autonomous systems in this new reality.</p><p></p><p><strong>This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.<br></strong><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/expert-contributor-network/"><strong>Want to join?</strong></a></p></div></div></div></div></p>

			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>North Korea-aligned threat actor BlueNoroff, also known under aliases APT38 and TA444, has resurfaced with two new campaigns dubbed GhostCall and GhostHire, targeting executives, Web3 developers, and blockchain professionals.</p><p>According to Kasperskys Securelist researchers, the campaigns rely on social engineering via platforms like Telegram and LinkedIn to send fake meeting invites and eventually deliver multi-stage malware chains to compromise macOS and Windows hosts.</p><p>BlueNoroff is a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/560979/kaspersky-lab-reveals-direct-link-between-banking-heist-hackers-and-north-korea.html">financially motivated subgroup</a> of the Lazarus Group, North Koreas state-sponsored cyber unit linked to the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), and is believed to operate the long-running SnatchCrypto campaign, of which GhostCall and GhostHire appear to be the latest extensions.</p><p>Researchers noted that the new campaigns highlight BlueNoroffs shift toward modular malware, cross-platform threats, and highly tailored targeting of the blockchain space. The malware samples were found written in multiple programming languages, including Go, Rust, Nim, and AppleScript, reflecting an added technical layer in the groups operations.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Compromise through fake investor meetings</h2><p>In the GhostCall campaign, BlueNoroff poses as venture capitalists or startup founders seeking to invest in blockchain projects. The attackers set up fake video meetings via platforms like Zoom or Teams, luring victims into a false sense of legitimacy.</p><p>During or after these calls, the victim is asked to install a supposed update or plugin to improve connection quality. The file, of course, is malicioustriggering a chain of implants such as DownTroy, CosmicDoor, and Rootroy, each performing specialized tasks like credential theft, keylogging, or persistence.</p><p>Once inside the target environment, the malware seeks out crypto wallet data, SSH keys, and project credentialsanything that could enable financial theft or lateral movement within corporate infrastructure. The campaign also deploys exfiltration routines to extract sensitive project data back to BlueNoroffs servers, often obfuscated with custom encryption and encoded in hexadecimal to avoid detection.</p><p>Securelist researchers emphasized that GhostCall marks a major leap in operational stealth compared to earlier BlueNoroff operations. The attackers use multiple layers of staging and dynamic command-and-control switching, allowing the malware to remain dormant until it detects activity in crypto-related directories or developer tools.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Fake recruiters with real malware</h2><p>The GhostHire operation takes a different approach, targeting Web3 developers through fake job offers and recruitment tests. Here BlueNoroff sets up fake developer tasks, often hosted on GitHub or shared via Telegram bots. Based on historical attack cases of this campaign, we assess with medium confidence that this attack flow involving Telegram and GitHub represents the latest phase, which started no later than April this year, researchers<a href="https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-apt-campaigns-ghostcall-and-ghosthire/117842/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> said</a>.</p><p>Victims are told to complete a coding challenge for a potential employer, only to receive a ZIP archive or Git repository containing the malware. Once executed, GhostHire deploys system reconnaissance modules that determine the victims OSmacOS or Windowsand then selectively downloads the right payload.</p><p>These payloads share the same modular DNA as GhostCalls tools, designed to escalate privileges, capture credentials, and open backdoors. Researchers noted that the social engineering component is particularly convincing, with attackers sometimes maintaining week-long correspondence to earn the victims trust before deploying the payload. Recently, BlueNoroff and its parent, Lazarus Group, have expanded their operations with the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3831315/bybits-1-5b-hack-linked-to-north-koreas-lazarus-group.html">$1.5 billion Bybit heist</a>, npm-supply-chain <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/north-korean-apt-lazarus-targets-developers-with-malicious-npm-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacks</a>, and <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009603/north-koreas-bluenoroff-uses-ai-deepfakes-to-push-mac-malware-in-fake-zoom-calls.html">Mac-focused malware </a>targeting blockchain developers.</p></div></div></div></div></p>

			<h3>Volvos recent security breach: 5 tips to speed incident response while preserving forensic integrity</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>In August 2025, Volvo Group North America disclosed that it had been impacted by a data breach originating in its third-party HR software provider, Miljdata. Although Volvo insisted its internal systems remained untouched, the timeline of detection and disclosure raises questions about forensic readiness and incident-response maturity.</p><p>Miljdata first detected suspicious activity on August 23, three days after what appeared to have been the initial intrusion. It wasnt until September 2 that they confirmed Volvo data had been exfiltrated and only then did they notify Volvo. That nearly two-week lag between detection and verified data exfiltration invites speculation around both forensic delay and communication gaps.</p><p>The breached data reportedly included Social Security numbers and other sensitive employee identifiers, classic crown-jewel data that can immediately trigger identity theft, regulatory scrutiny and class-action litigation. Volvo has offered its employees 18 months of identity-protection services, but such downstream measures are only damage control. What really matters in high-stakes incidents is how quickly and thoroughly your forensic response is conducted within the first 48 to 72 hours.</p><p>From over a decade of experience, including time as a computer forensic specialist at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, one thing is clear: In breaches involving sensitive data, a slow or shaky response isnt just a strategic misstep; its a litigation vector.</p><p>Below are five key recommendations to help organizations respond rapidly and preserve forensic integrity, even when the breach begins in someone elses network.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-integrate-forensics-from-day-zero-not-as-an-afterthought">1. Integrate forensics from day zero, not as an afterthought</h2><p>All too often, organizations treat forensic collection as something that is brought in after a breach has been confirmed. A mature incident-response (IR) program embeds forensic readiness in its playbooks:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Identify and catalog your evidence sources in advance (endpoints, memory, logs, cloud assets)</li><li>Stage scripts or agents that can snapshot memory and archive logs immediately when an IR trigger fires</li><li>Make forensic collection part of containment, not something you tack on afterward</li></ul><p>Modern approaches and even <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NISTs updated guidance</a> emphasize that evidence gathering should begin during, not after, containment. Too many organizations wait for clean proof of impact before launching forensics and by then, critical volatile artifacts (such as memory, file metadata and process chains) may be lost or overwritten.</p><p>Embedding forensics from day zero also sharpens board-level visibility. When executives are briefed with clear, time-stamped evidence early in the crisis, decisions about disclosure, containment and external engagement become fact-driven instead of speculative.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-align-ir-and-forensic-goals-via-shared-metrics-and-priorities">2. Align IR and forensic goals via shared metrics and priorities</h2><p><a></a>A perennial tension in breach response is that incident responders often want to restore systems quickly, while forensic teams wish to preserve every trace. If priorities arent aligned in advance, you risk destroying evidence by rebooting endpoints, rotating logs or committing irreversible changes. To prevent that:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Define shared metrics in your IR playbooks, e.g., no endpoint reboot before memory capture, or logs preserved for 72 hours minimum.</li><li>Escalate conflicts immediately to legal or leadership roles during incident execution.</li><li>Rehearse these tradeoffs in tabletop exercises, simulating situations where speed versus evidence preservation must be balanced.</li></ul><p>Hybrid DFIR frameworks increasingly emphasize that restoration and forensics shouldnt be sequential silos; they must be integrated. The newer NIST SP 800-61 Revision 3 even <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2025/06/nist-launches-updated-incident-response-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abandons rigid life cycle models in favor of integrating detect, respond and recover functions with forensic awareness</a>.</p><p>This alignment also requires that legal and compliance teams sit at the same table. Counsel should help codify thresholds for evidence retention that satisfy both regulatory expectations (e.g., GDPRs breach-notification timelines) and litigation discovery rules.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-automate-collection-and-triage-to-reduce-human-delay">3. Automate collection and triage to reduce human delay</h2><p>Manual forensic collection is slow and error-prone. The faster you automate snapshotting, log ingestion, metadata extraction and initial triage, the sooner you can surface smoking-gun artifacts before they vanish. Key practices:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Trigger forensic scripts or agents automatically upon IR event indicators (e.g., suspicious endpoint alerts).</li><li>Use machine-learning or heuristic classifiers in the initial triage to flag anomalous files, processes or timeline anomalies, helping analysts prioritize their tasks effectively. Recent research from <a href="https://www.futureengineeringjournal.com/uploads/archives/20250714190246_FEI-2025-4-018.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Engineering Journal</a> supports this for DFIR tasks.</li><li>Hash, timestamp and ledger are all artifacts automatically used to strengthen the chain of custody.</li></ul><p>Automation also helps prevent human error, especially under stress, and ensures consistency in handling large-scale evidence. In a breach like Volvos, the faster you can parse which employee records, SSNs or identifiers were exposed, the better your legal and mitigation posture will be.</p><p>The newest generation of DFIR platforms even integrates with SIEM and SOAR systems to trigger evidence capture the moment an anomaly crosses a defined confidence threshold. That fusion of security automation and forensic control will soon become a baseline expectation in cyber insurance underwriting.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-manage-third-party-risk-with-prepared-ir-contracts-and-coordination">4. Manage third-party risk with prepared IR contracts and coordination</h2><p>Volvos case is emblematic of a supply-chain breach. The forensic clock started ticking in Miljdatas systems well before Volvo had visibility. To anticipate this:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Contractually require your vendors to grant timely access (for forensic analysis), synchronized metrics (e.g., time-to-notification) and early handoff of data/images in breach scenarios.</li><li>Maintain joint IR runbooks with high-risk vendors so teams know exactly who activates what when, without renegotiation under duress.</li><li>Conduct tabletop exercises jointly with vendors to test whether your coordination works under pressure.</li></ul><p>When the vendor becomes the root cause, you dont want to waste hours negotiating access or waiting for them to assemble logs. That delay can destroy evidence.</p><p>The average enterprise now relies on dozens of SaaS and HR platforms that process sensitive data. Yet few have verified what happens if a vendor refuses forensic access or hides behind legal review. The NIST Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management guidance and frameworks, such as <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/82890.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ISO 27036</a>, emphasize the importance of contractual preparation, but adoption lags significantly.</p><p>Equally important is establishing reciprocal reporting obligations. If your data appears in a vendors compromise, you should be notified within hours, not weeks, so that you can activate your own containment and legal teams immediately.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-rethink-reporting-communication-and-escalation-for-legal-risk">5. Rethink reporting, communication and escalation for legal risk</h2><p><a></a>Even the most technically perfect response can fail if messaging is mishandled. Misleading or incomplete statements make you vulnerable to reputational damage, regulatory backlash and plaintiff claims. Heres how to safeguard:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Involve legal, compliance and general counsel within hours, not days. They should guide messaging consistent with the forensic state of fact-finding.</li><li>Document every decision to isolate, restore or alter systems, including the evidence and logic behind it, to show defensible reasoning.</li><li>Delay absolutes. Avoid statements like no internal systems were impacted until you have forensic confirmation. In Volvos case, early statements of non-compromise risk appear to be cover-ups.</li><li>Map out regulatory and litigation exposure immediately (privacy, negligence, vendor liability) and design forensic returns to support or rebut each claim.</li></ul><p>Poor or delayed public reporting can magnify the damage, even if your internal forensic work was impeccable. The narrative matters. Regulators, such as the FTC, SEC and the European Data Protection Board, now scrutinize timeliness as closely as technical containment. In the U.S., the SECs 2023 cyber-incident rule <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2023/33-11216.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requires disclosure within four business days of determining materiality</a>  an almost impossible window without forensic readiness.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-speed-and-integrity-matter">Why speed and integrity matter</h2><p>In high-profile breaches, the differentiator is often not so much that a violation occurred, but how it was handled. A well-executed forensic response can mitigate claims of negligence, demonstrate that contaminated systems were correctly isolated and limit the exposure window. Thats especially true when sensitive employee data (SSNs, identifiers) are involved.</p><p>In Volvos case, the nearly two-week lag between Miljdatas detection and data confirmation warrants scrutiny. Whether it reflected a process gap or a focus on continuity over investigation, the delay increased legal exposure.</p><p>The lesson: forensic readiness, automation, pre-arranged vendor coordination and disciplined communication arent optional.</p><p>Organizations that invest in these capabilities also gain secondary benefits. Faster forensic cycles reduce downtime, improve insurer confidence and strengthen the credibility of post-incident reporting to regulators and the public.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-broader-takeaway">The broader takeaway</h2><p>The Volvo-Miljdata incident is a microcosm of a growing trend: third-party breaches are accelerating and accountability is shifting downstream. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 60% of security incidents will originate from vendor ecosystems. Yet only a fraction of enterprises have built forensic clauses or joint IR drills into their vendor management programs.</p><p>For CISOs and CIOs, the immediate imperative is clear:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Treat forensic readiness as part of cyber resilience, not a post-mortem investigation.</li><li>Embed automation and logging in every high-risk workflow.</li><li>Rehearse multiparty breach scenarios that include vendors, counsel and communications.</li><li>Design transparency into your playbook. The truth will come out; you must ensure its supported by evidence.</li></ol><p>The ultimate measure of maturity isnt avoiding every breach. Its how quickly you can reconstruct the truth, contain the damage and communicate with credibility. An organizations ability to act fast and cleanly under duress is often the difference between too little, too late and a responsible, accountable response.</p><p></p><p><strong>This article is published as part of the Foundry Expert Contributor Network.<br></strong><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/expert-contributor-network/"><strong>Want to join?</strong></a></p></div></div></div></div></p>
