			<h3>Sample: New Phishing Campaign</h3>
			<p>A recently observed phishing campaign employs a multi-stage redirection technique to lure victims into providing sensitive information. Attackers utilize a series of redirects – each designed to appear legitimate – to progressively guide users toward a malicious destination. This tactic aims to bypass initial security measures and increase the likelihood of successful credential harvesting. The campaign&#39;s effectiveness is potentially amplified by sophisticated social engineering methods.</p>

			<h3>Sample: Container escape in NVIDIA toolkit</h3>
			<p>This article details a significant container escape vulnerability discovered within the NVIDIA toolkit. The vulnerability allows for unauthorized access and potential compromise of the underlying host system. Specifically, the toolkit’s container runtime exhibits a flaw enabling an attacker to break out of the container environment, potentially leading to privilege escalation and system takeover.  Further investigation is needed to fully understand the scope of the impact and develop mitigation strategies.</p>
