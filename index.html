			<h3>That CISO job offer could be a pig-butchering scam</h3>
			<p><div id="remove_no_follow"><div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column">  <div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"><div class="article-column__content"><section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section><p>The recent experience of a seasoned security leader illustrates how fake job offers are increasingly being used as entry points for pig-butchering scams.</p><p>Pig-butchering scams are a form of investment fraud that exploit social engineering to build a relationship with a prospective mark before butchering them financially, often through cryptocurrency or other fake investments.</p><p>Fraudsters purportedly representing Gemini Crypto, a US-based cryptocurrency trading platform, tried to leave US CISO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wbjw3/">Walter Williams</a> at a minimum of $1,000 out of pocket through a sustained campaign that lasted more than three months between May and September 2025. The pretext of a confidential job search for a CISO was plausible enough for Williams to play along despite quickly realizing the approach was suspect.</p><p>They initially reached out to me on LinkedIn, but not from a Gemini account, Williams, a part-time infosec consultant, told CSO. Im figuring that they found me through a search on LinkedIn and thought Id make a good target since I am open to work.</p><p>Williams added: The reason I gave them even a moment of my time  as the initial contact was odd enough to signal something was wrong  was because I had reached out to them in January and they might be following up with me.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="first-contact">First contact</h2><p>In January Williams applied to Gemini Crypto for a director of security GRC role via its official website, receiving no more than a standard email acknowledgement of his job application.</p><p>Months later in May a recruitment representative from Gemini Groups human resources department approached Williams through LinkedIn about an initially unspecified senior leadership position. A reply from Williams saying he might be interested and offering his contact details was met with an ungrammatical reply.</p><p>Soon after, Williams received an SMS message from Li Jiaxin, supposed head of Geminis Los Angeles branch and a member of the board of directors, referencing an application for a CISO role. A few quick checks by Williams revealed that Gemini Crypto neither has a Los Angeles office nor a listed board member named Li Jiaxin, but he decided to play along to see where this outreach would lead.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deepfaked-interview-shenanigans">Deepfaked interview shenanigans</h2><p>What followed was three months of constant messaging, which moved from SMS messages, to conversations on WhatsApp, to a (likely) <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3982379/deepfake-attacks-are-inevitable-cisos-cant-prepare-soon-enough.html">deepfaked</a> video interview.</p><p>Other than the 15-minute interview, mostly my interaction with them was a minute here and there, and of course the necessary background research on Gemini itself as well as the person who was trying to scam me, Williams explained. She has a Facebook profile to match the WhatsApp profile and periodically changes her profile picture but not much else.</p><p>The interview itself was weird, Williams said.</p><p>The interview[er] asked me questions about my career and hopes for relations with the CEO, CFO, and CIO, Williams said. There were no technical questions.</p><p>Williams added: She never moved her head other than to speak; no blinking, no expressions. I saw no part of her body except the face. The tone of her voice was very matter of fact; no inflection.</p><p>Having successfully negotiated the interview, Williams was offered the role and a generous salary package. However, before taking up this position Williams was required to complete mandatory training in cryptocurrency derivatives.</p><p>He was instructed to purchase $1,000 in cryptocurrency through Coinbase from his own funds to carry out this training. Williams declined and was rebuffed when he suggested the funds could be taken from an advance on his first months salary, bringing the dialogue to an end.</p><p>Ive no idea how extensive this is, but the criminals were rather well prepared for a CISO as a target, so theyd done their research, Williams told CSO.</p><p>My motivation to keep going was there was just enough substance in their conversation to make this 50% plausible that this was real, he added.</p><p>Williams documented the entire exchange  complete with commentary  in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/very-long-con-how-criminal-organization-tried-trick-me-williams-r2aze/">post on LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>They were investing a lot of time into this  three months of constant messages  and had some interesting techniques  the e-signed contract [tied to a Gmail address]  that I thought would make a good story to share, Williams told CSO.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pig-butchering-dissected">Pig-butchering dissected</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-jess/">Ashley Jess</a>, Intel 471s senior intelligence analyst, said the mechanism of the fraud documented by Williams is typical of pig-butchering scams.</p><p>Threat actors frequently initiate contact on legitimate, trusted platforms  for example, LinkedIn job posts or recruiter outreach  because those venues lower a victims guard, Jess explained. Once rapport is established, the conversation is moved to private channels  WhatsApp, Telegram, DM  and then eventually to sham trading or investment sites where the victim is encouraged to deposit funds, though they may begin on a legitimate platform, such as in this example, before moving to an illegitimate one.</p><p>Pig butchering is a deliberate, long-game fraud that relies on building a relationship over time more than a single, cunning trick.</p><p>The long sample interaction the CISO shared is exactly what investigators expect: daily check-ins, career talk, and seemingly innocuous coffee chats that gradually morph into financial conversations, Jess added. That grooming phase, which can last weeks or months, is what makes the scam so damaging and allows the attackers to push victims into large transfers with convincing narratives and staged returns.</p><p>Chainalysis estimated crypto fraud at roughly US$12.4 billion in 2024, with highyield investment and pig-butchering scams representing large proportions of that figure.</p><p>This year alone, we at Intel 471 have helped research and identify thousands of fake investment platforms, Jess explained. Increasingly were seeing threat actors weaponize fake job offers as an entry point because job hunting normalizes high-value conversations  salary, investments, remote work  and creates plausible pretexts to move off-platform.</p><p>The potential for millions in illicit earnings help explain why attackers play the long game by building trust before attempting financial theft.</p><p>Threat actors use AI-generated profiles, deepfake videos and phone calls, and realistic onboarding materials, carefully staging everything they communicate to make the scam highly convincing, even to the most seasoned cybersecurity professionals, said <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/author/ch4p">Haris Pylarinos</a>, CEO of Hack The Box.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="coding-challenges-laced-with-malware">Coding challenges laced with malware</h2><p>In some cases, fake recruiters have given the scam a mendacious twist by sending candidates test assignments booby-trapped with malware that can infect their devices and steal sensitive data.</p><p>Palo Alto Network Unit 42 intelligence unit recently discovered a North Korean threat group known as <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/slow-pisces-new-custom-malware/">Slow Pisces (aka Jade Sleet) running a targeted campaign impersonating LinkedIn recruiters</a>. They send malware-laced coding challenges to developers in the crypto space, aiming to compromise networks and steal data. This campaign is linked to high-profile cryptocurrency thefts  reportedly over $1.5B stolen in 2023 alone.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vigilence-required">Vigilence required</h2><p>Williams experience shows that CISOs are not exempt from social engineering and phishing attacks.</p><p>Fraudsters are skilled at building out convincing recruitment narratives that mirror real hiring processes, often referencing genuine applications and company details to build credibility  something capable of catching out even seasoned professionals.</p><p>Intel 471s Jess advised: Practical takeaway: Verify unsolicited recruiters and job offers through company HR channels, avoid moving conversations to unfamiliar private apps, never send money or seed investments to someone you havent independently verified, and report suspicious outreach to the platform immediately.</p></div></div></div></div></p>

If you havent heard about us, you can Google about us on the Internet, began one of the ransom notes, re-published by a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-patches-ebs-zero-day-exploited-in-clop-data-theft-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news site</a>.</p><p>The note went on to make the usual demand for payment, backed by threats to expose stolen data if ransom was not paid.</p><p>The worry was how the attackers were compromising victims. During 2025, Oracle has patched several important EBS security issues, including <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2025-30727</a> affecting the iSurvey Module, and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2025-21541</a> affecting Admin Screens and Grants UI, neither known to have been exploited.</p><p>The flaw exploited as part of the latest attack remains in question. A blog last week by Oracles CSO, <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/authors/rob-duhart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Duhart</a>, indicated that multiple vulnerabilities from the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July 2025 Oracle Critical Patch Update (CPU)</a> might be involved. However, this was later updated to remove that reference.</p><p>A post by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charlescarmakal_oracle-security-alert-advisory-cve-2025-activity-7380595612443893760-JNd_/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Carmakal of Mandiant</a> still refers to multiple vulnerabilities, but the focus has now shifted to a new remote code execution (RCE) flaw, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2025-61882</a>, as the main culprit. The fact that Oracle issued <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an emergency patch</a> for it during the weekend seems to confirm this.</p><p>Initial access by Cl0p dates to August, which means that attackers have had plenty of time to steal large amounts of data. Extortion emails were sent to victims from September 29 onwards, but might not yet have reached all victims, Carmakal cautioned.</p><p>Given the broad mass 0-day exploitation that has already occurred (and the n-day exploitation that will likely continue by other actors), irrespective of when the patch is applied, organizations should examine whether they were already compromised, he said.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="red-alert-patch-now">Red alert: Patch now</h2><p>Rated a critical 9.8 on CVSS, CVE-2025-61882 is a vulnerability in the EBS BI Publisher Integration component of Oracle E-Business Suite affecting <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">versions 12.2.3 to 12.2.14</a>, which is remotely exploitable without authentication.</p><p>Customers should apply the latest patch after first applying the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical patch update from October 2023</a> if they hadnt already done so. Any versions of the software updated before October 4 should be considered at risk.</p><p>Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply the updates provided by this Security Alert as soon as possible, the company warned.</p><p>Oracle also published a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs), including IP addresses, observed commands, and malware signatures, to aid in detection.</p><p>Its likely that almost no one patched over the weekend. Were waking up to a critical vulnerability with public exploit code and unpatched systems everywhere, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-knott-046939107/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake Knott</a>, principal security researcher at continuous security testing company, <a href="https://watchtowr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">watchTowr</a>.</p><p>We fully expect to see mass, indiscriminate exploitation from multiple groups within days. If you run Oracle EBS, this is your red alert. Patch immediately, hunt aggressively, and tighten your controls  fast.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zbyneksopuch/?originalSubdomain=cz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zbynk Sopuch</a>, CTO of data security vendor, <a href="https://www.safetica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safetica</a>, enterprises should also note the evolving cyber criminal behavior signaled by recent ransomware attacks.</p><p>The targeted systems-of-choice for thieves include ERP, finance, HR, and the typical points of entry are via admin credentials and third-party connectors, such as VPNs, middleware, and API service accounts, which tend to have open access privileges, said Sopuch.</p><p>He recommended that companies isolate critical applications as much as possible, while making protections such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) standard for admin logins and integration or API access points.</p><p>Conversely, give service and integration accounts minimum access or simple access-appropriate-to-role permissions, and routinely rotate keys, he said.</p><p>Zero-day vulnerabilities seem to be particularly favored by Cl0p, with the 2023 attack against the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/575481/clop-ransomware-gang-exploits-the-moveit-transfer-vulnerability-to-steal-data.html?utm=hybrid_search" target="_blank">MOVEit file transfer customers</a> exploiting CVE-2023-34362 a high-profile example. Other attacks with the same approach included those against Accellion in 2020, and SolarWinds in 2021.</p><p>The lesson is that organizations can detect incursions only if they are continuously monitoring all risk points in the attack surface, such as external access points and logins, said Sopuch.</p></div></div></div></div></p>
