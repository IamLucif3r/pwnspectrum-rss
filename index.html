			<h3>Wrap Up: The Month of AI Bugs</h3>
			<p>This article summarizes a month-long investigation into vulnerabilities related to large language models (LLMs) and prompt injection attacks. The research revealed multiple instances where LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Amazon Q, were susceptible to data exfiltration through prompt injection, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive information, remote code execution, and potential network compromise. Several projects, such as Season Finale’s AgentHopper, highlighted the risks of AI viruses and exposed security flaws in model integrations. The findings emphasize the critical need for robust input validation and security controls when utilizing LLMs.</p>

			<h3>Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration</h3>
			<p>Recent updates to Google Bard, particularly the introduction of Extensions, have introduced new vulnerabilities. These extensions grant Bard access to user data like Drive, Docs, and Gmail, enabling analysis of potentially untrusted information. This creates opportunities for vulnerabilities like prompt injection attacks, where malicious prompts can manipulate the model&#39;s behavior. The article demonstrates how prompt injection can be leveraged to extract data from user documents.</p>

			<h3>WatchGuard patches critical VPN flaw in firewalls that could lead to compromise</h3>
			<p>WatchGuard has identified and patched a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-9242) within its Firebox firewall systems, specifically related to Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) configurations. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution via crafted attacks targeting VPN ports UDP 500 or UDP 4500. Despite the lack of confirmed exploitation, the CVSS score of 9.3 highlights the urgency of remediation. The vulnerability&#39;s complexity arises from the potential for persistent IKE configuration data, even after configuration deletions. Given the increasing targeting of firewalls by ransomware groups (as seen with attacks on SonicWall and Fortinet systems), immediate patching is paramount. WatchGuard provides mitigation steps for those unable to update immediately.</p>
