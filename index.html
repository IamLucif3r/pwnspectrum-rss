			<h3>ChatGPT: Hacking Memories with Prompt Injection</h3>
			<p>OpenAI&#39;s implementation of persistent memory within ChatGPT introduces a potential security vulnerability. Specifically, ‘Indirect Prompt Injection’ allows attackers to influence the model&#39;s memory, potentially leading to the introduction of misleading data, biased outputs, or even the erasure of stored information. This represents a critical risk to data integrity and model reliability.</p>
